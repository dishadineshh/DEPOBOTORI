IS OUR ATTENTION SPAN DOOMED? The 8-second scroll on Instagram


There's a goldfish out there with better focus than GenZ. 


Remember when we could actually focus on a single thing for more than a hot minute? Research from @Microsoft that the attention span on platforms like Instagram has crashed down to a shocking eight seconds. This isn't just a quirky stat – it's a shift for marketers and content creators.


  



GenZ is raised on social media and it thrives on bite-sized content. It is a game-changer for anyone trying to grab attention online. Imagine this: 
You craft a perfect message, only to have 90% of the viewers swipe away before they even finish the first sentence. Hurts, right?


  









This isn't a dead end, but a challenge. 
How can you as a marketer create & deliver better? 


  



1. GenZ values Authenticity above all else.
If the content feels forced, GenZ is quick to discern. Brands must prioritize authentic storytelling like real-life stories, testimonials, and user-generated content that establishes a genuine connection.
For eg, the popular Duolingo owl is a social media darling.
Duolingo started this campaign and decided to use a quirky and relatable owl mascot to promote language learning. The mascot's humorous interactions on social media resonated with Gen Z's love of memes and lighthearted content while achieving the brand's objective.


2. Short-form video content, please.
The powerhouse to capture attention is short-form video content, be it on IG reels or YouTube shorts. Whether it is showing BTS glimpses or sharing updates, this is a dynamic way to connect with GenZ effortlessly.
For eg, have you ever noticed Hubspot’s instagram? 
HubSpot understands that B2B audiences (businesses and professionals) are bombarded with information. Their short-form video strategy focuses on delivering valuable content in a way that's informative, educational, and engaging and in shorter, more playful content formats, like behind-the-scenes glimpses at their company culture or quick marketing hacks.


3. The value of peer-to-peer recommendations.
User-generated content campaigns encourage consumers to create and share content related to the brand, product, or campaign. This fosters a sense of community and belonging while amplifying brand reach.
For eg, American Express -  Ambassador Program
American Express established an ambassador program with a network of micro-influencers who aligned with their target audience (entrepreneurs, frequent travellers).
These micro-influencers then shared their experiences using Amex cards and the benefits they provided for their businesses and travel lifestyles which created more relatability and trust compared to traditional celebrity marketing.




4. Personalise the experience for your GenZ users.
GenZ expects personalised experiences made for their individual preferences. Leverage data-driven insights and deliver targeted content, that feels genuine to each user on a personal level.
For eg, we all love our Spotify Wrapped & Discover Weekly
Spotify uses data on listening habits to curate personalised playlists like ‘Wrapped’ (yearly summary) and ‘Discover Weekly’ (new music recommendations). This taps right into GenZ’s desire for curated experiences and individuality, by getting recommendations tailored to their tastes, fostering a sense of connection.


So, what are you waiting for? Let's make content that keeps the audience hooked, not hooked on the ""scroll"" button. 
P.S. How are YOU adapting to the ever-shrinking attention span? Share your tips and tricks in the comments below!

> Have we tuned out of the jingles?


> Sometimes, a tune gets stuck in my head & IT. DOES. NOT. STOP. 


Audiences are evolving. From seeing 40-60-second ads to getting used to 15-second reels, with brands competing for our attention, jingles have become scarce.
Interruptions are not welcomed.  If someone finds an ad intruding and there is an option to skip, one will do so. 


Lets go back a bit though - what even are jingles? 
A jingle is basically a short, catchy, easy-to-remember song or tune used in advertising and marketing campaigns to promote a brand, product, or service.


Did you know the first radio jingle came out almost a hundred years ago. A breakfast cereal commercial for a brand called Wheaties launched ‘Have You Tried Wheaties’ in 1926. - Wheaties Jingle - Have You Tried Wheaties?


  



It was only in the 80s when jingle marketing picked up in India. An increase in radio and television sets made advertising houses focus on both marketing channels and creativity. 


We all know the infamous Nirma girl, right? The ‘washing powder Nirma’ (if you didn’t read this but sang this, Hi5) became one of the most famous and influential advertising jingles in that decade.


  



All these jingles made in the 90s, from Bajaj’s ‘Humara Bajaj’ or Cadbury’s ‘kuch khaas hai hum sabhi mein’ live rent-free in our head. But have you ever wondered why?


Why do I remember jingles more than I thought I ever would?


Weird right, how certain music gets stuck in our heads more often than others? 


The science behind this is simple - earworms. 


Earworms are snippets of music that are pushed into your brain almost subconsciously - the ones that pop in your head for no reason.


They are stored under the umbrella of involuntary memory, a component that occurs when cues encountered in everyday life trigger recollections without any conscious effort. 


We don’t go out of our way to jam to ‘sabki pasand nirma’ jingle over and over again - its existence confuses our neutral circuits.


The right thing to ask is - why were jingles popular back then vs what happened now?


Let’s try to connect the dots.


> Radio was introduced in India in 1922, but it was only in the 1990s when FM broadcasting actually became an every Indian household thing. That’s also when the Indian economy was booming, which led to a push for TVs to become more common. 
> There was a mix of creativity and usage of proper marketing channels during this time. The internet era boomed, liberalisation took place and advertising jingles and slogans became the norm. Everyone eagerly watched the ads too, unlike today.
> Television evolved from radio and in radio, jingles were obviously more important than visuals. Few years and some great ad jingles later, TV ad industry moved away from its radio roots, and jingles became less important than visuals.
> Soon enough, special effects and CGI (computer-generated imagery) happened. 




The modern audience is more attracted to ads that look good. 
So, the ad industry has been focusing more on making their ads visually impressive first. 


Moreover, buying music rights of popular songs viewers already listen to is easier. No jingle writer to be hired,  no song to be written, no music rights to take care of, no special instruments or a team to hire — the visuals are edited together with the sound and the rest takes care of itself. Sounds a little less hectic, doesn’t it?


Fast forward to 2024, and in the reel era, jingles are close to non-existent.  
Packing the idea, adding a surprise and making it iconic enough to make an impact is challenging.




The formula to make a jingle?
Probably not that easy. And it is definitely not rhyming two words.


The two important things to keep in mind are: melody composition and brand message integration.
Your melody must be catchy, memorable and reflects your brand’s personality. It should evoke emotions in the listener, feeling somewhat attached to the brand. 


It is essential to strike a balance between advertising effectiveness to convey selling points while maintaining musicality and quality. 


While doing our research, we found an AI tool to create a jingle. It was fun tbh. You should give it a shot too: https://www.aijinglemaker.com/


The impact of jingles on consumer behaviour


Songs and jingles evoke emotions, create brand recognition, and establish an emotional connection between consumers and brands, influencing consumer behaviour and decision-making. The repetitive nature of jingles reinforces brand messaging, making it memorable and creating familiarity with the product, which leads to increased trust and a sense of community among consumers.


According to a report, an electroencephalogram (EEG), a test that measures brain activity by recording the electrical signals produced by the brain took place. The average purchase intention of the group who heard music was 4.36, while the group without music averaged 3.64.


The people BTS of creating our favourite jingles


1. Kailash Surendranath: Created the jingle for Nirma's washing powder ad
  



2. Vanraj Bhatia: Composed music for the legendary Cadbury and Humara Bajaj ads.
  



3. AR Rahman: Wrote for Hum Mein Hai Hero - Hero MotoCorp TV Commercial Ad
  



Arguably the most significant growth phase came in the 90s. Advertising jingles and slogans became the norm.


How is the industry looking for jingle writers in today’s time?

While jingle writing was once a thriving industry, it's significantly declined in recent years. The rise of digital advertising, streaming services, and shorter attention spans has made traditional jingles not so relevant anymore.


From jingles to singles, marketing trends have changed from recording original ad tunes to using popular music as a background for ads today. With chart-toppers already in the hearts and minds of consumers, it is an easier and faster way to create impressions. That without the hassle of rhyming scripts and composing tunes. Thus came the end of the jingle era that we were ever so fond of.


Do we love the jingles that were once made and still sing them in our heads? Yes.
Do we think jingles won’t work anymore? Probably yes too. Our reel-ready brain isn’t up for it yet.




________________




























(DO NOT USE)


Old version


Brands today avoid experimenting with jingles, despite helping with brand recall and evoking nostalgia within the audience. 


Jingles have been a powerful part of advertising for decades. Be it emotional connection, memorability, brand identity reinforcement or nostalgia that feels like a warm fuzzy feeling when we think about ‘good old days’, jingles had a lasting impact on the minds of consumers.

> Was it an actual job/thing people did? 
> Formula to correct jingle making


Has social media killed advertising jingles?


There was a time in the Indian Advertisement Industry when every ad had a small, catchy jingle associated with it and more often than not, these jingles were able to grab the consumer’s attention. Who can forget the “Do Minute Ruk Sakte Hain……” ad for Maggi Noodles or the “Kuch Khass hai Zindagi mein…….” for Cadbury’s or the “Yeh dil maange more” commercial for Pepsi.

(humara bajaj ad image)


https://youtu.be/CbNTcvzrpBY
https://youtu.be/opnYzUidXXM?feature=shared


  





The use of jingles in the ads has considerably declined. 


The actual challenge for both the ad-maker and the brand is to ensure that their ad has the same impact even when it is played years after it was aired for the first time. 


A typical example here are the ads which the Nirma Group came up with, a decade or two ago. 
The challenge for advertising is to deliver the brand message in merely a few seconds, especially online.


  



To market music in the age of 15 seconds and reels is a tough task. To pack the idea, add a surprise and make it iconic enough to make an impact sounds a bit disruptive, especially with reducing attention spans.


Audiences are evolving. Interruptions are not welcomed.  If someone finds an ad intruding and there is an option to skip, one will do so. The challenge for advertising is to deliver the brand message in merely a few seconds, especially online.




What’s the deal with mascots though?


From Ronald McDonald to Amul Girl or Vodafone ZooZoos, mascots have been an integral part of elevating and differentiating brands while creating strong connections. But with the fast-paced digital world and varied audience, brand mascots have lost their mojo.


​​Even though brand mascots might be as stuck in the past as you might think. They’ve evolved, adapted, and even thrived in the digital age, but they’re just not necessarily taking centre stage anymore.


One brand doing this is HyFun Foods, a frozen food manufacturer from India, which has recently created a brand mascot called Funzy. 


The mascots help differentiate the brand in a crowded category and build relevance with Gen Z and Gen Alpha who value authenticity. 


With the rise of social media platforms, it provides a unique opportunity for mascots to engage with audiences better.




  









Songs evoke emotions, create brand recognition and establish an emotional connection between consumers and brands, which influences consumer behaviour and decision making.


Jingles are supposed to be repetitive, which helps reinforce brand messaging and make it memorable. This creates familiarity with the product, which can lead to increased trust in the brand. Jingles also have the power to create a sense of community amongst consumers with similar interests.

Can you win your ex-customers back? 


It’s difficult to see your customers leave. The ones you put effort in, built a relationship with, the ones you built the next big thing with…and just like that, they leave, without any warning.


There’s no way around these breakups. You didn’t think that once you find a client they stay with you forever, did you? Even the most loyal customers may part ways with your agency, for a number of reasons. And then all that’s left to think about is -  “How do you cope with losing a client?”


The big question is - what makes a client leave?
Sure, it is not necessarily your fault when it happens. Clients come and go.
The Martin Agency lost Walmart to Publicis Groupe after half a decade of working together. Big agencies have a well-earned reputation and high credibility – some of their clients still decide to part ways with them. So, if it happens to you, it does not mean that you did something wrong. Your clients may have had their own reasons. 


Consider the client’s perspective before going into the self-analysis (or self-doubt) mode - budget constraints, better services elsewhere, management changes, and in-house teams. All these are fair reasons for a client to leave. 


But also, could it be your mistake? 
That’s the real question you need to ask yourself when you lose a client. Unclarified expectations, missing deadlines, flawed communication, no clear point of contact, and overcomplication - if these things happened, you probably messed up too. 


  



If you lose a customer because you failed them or because of miscommunication, they are likely to spread the word. The agency-client network isn’t that big. 


95% of unsatisfied customers share their negative opinions with others. 45% do it on social media, where 63% of consumers read their reviews and draw conclusions. You don’t want that.  - Source




The bigger question is HOW to get an old client back.


Even if your best client is gone, it doesn’t mean you cannot win them back. 


Here is a real-life example: 
A global shipping and logistic company, UPS (United Parcel Service) lost thousands of workers and clients in 1997, the company was on the brink of bankruptcy. In 1998, they increased their profits by 87% and returned stronger than ever. They called their clients, offered discounts, apologized, and reassured everyone that they got it. Humans understand humans, they were confident and cheerful this time. And guess what? It worked. 


A few tips on how to get your client back:


* Don’t rush: Your client had a reason to leave, and trying to get them right back will make things worse. Give it time, they might want to return later especially if you had a great client-agency relationship. Discover other avenues like inviting for events, offering pro-bono advice, periodic check-ins etc to stay within the client’s view instead of trying to get them back full-time. 
Also pro-tip: Learn why they stopped buying your services - For example, having a client feedback form to understand their pain points can help you have a better client-agency relationship in the future. 


* Make a new offer: Be patient. Take the time to make a unique offer that aligns with your former client’s current needs. During your time working together, they learned what to expect from you. A fresh offer could pleasantly surprise them and make them reconsider giving you another chance.


* Know about their business situation: When a client moves on, it might be due to a shift in their business model. To win them back, you need to understand their current needs. Treat them, in part, as if they were a brand-new client, approaching the situation with a fresh mindset.


* Most importantly, learn to move on: Sometimes after putting it your all, things do not work out. And that’s okay too. Just ensure you don't repeat the same mistakes with your new customers. 


Winning back ex-clients is all about showing them how you’ve grown and why partnering with you again is a smart move. With the right strategy, you might just turn those past clients into your most loyal advocates once more.

At Upload Digital, we’ve been with Rescript since its inception, shaping its branding, marketing, and digital presence from day one. From designing the iconic logo to debating shades of green on their packaging, to refining their website and executing growth strategies, this journey has been one of passion and precision.

* Massive brand visibility
* Consumer trust and credibility 
* Increased website traffic and engagement 
* A significant boost in sales & recognition
Scaling a brand isn’t easy; here’s why
Building a brand is one thing; scaling it is another. Rescript faced challenges familiar to many sustainable brands:

* Crafting a compelling digital-first presence 
* Educating audiences on why recycled paper products matter
And that’s where we came in.
Our Collaboration: Upload Digital x Rescript
Our partnership with Rescript has been built on trust, creativity, and shared values. Here’s how we helped them scale: 
* Developed a distinct visual identity & messaging that reflected sustainability. 
* Created two iterations of their website, optimising for UX, storytelling, and conversions. 
* Executed content and email strategies that drove engagement and sales. 
* Supported their presence at key events like Paperworld
Inside the Upload Digital war room: The Week of Shark Tank India

* Optimised for high traffic, seamless conversions, and tested under pressure.
* Monitored real-time data, identified trends, and doubled down on what worked best.
* Server checks, stress tests, and ensuring every click led to a flawless user experience.
* Cross-referenced Sony’s brand guidelines to ensure every mention and asset was aligned.
* Our design and tech teams worked tirelessly to keep every touchpoint polished and glitch-free.
* Deployed and refined campaigns to capitalize on the buzz.
* Strategic brainstorming on how to sustain engagement beyond the Shark Tank moment, both for Rescript and Upload Digital.
The results?
* 🚀 186K+ new users in the last year 
* 🚀53.7% average engagement rate 
* 🚀A brand that’s making a real impact in sustainability
Rescript’s Shark Tank journey is just the beginning. We’re proud to have been a part of their story, and we’re even more excited for what’s ahead.

Is “vibe marketing” just a fancy excuse to let AI do your job? Maybe. But also… maybe not.
AI is everywhere - ChatGPT is fueling Ghibli trends, Spotify’s AI curated list, and even Gemini AI is in our cars! And now, it's in the entire marketing world.
Enter ‘vibe marketing’- a term originating from the term ‘vibe coding’ by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, “where you fully give in to the vibes, embrace exponentials, and forget that the code even exists”. 
In marketing, it’s using AI to handle almost all the work, while you check if the work is done right.
So what really is ‘vibe marketing’?
Picture a traditional marketing firm. 
Content writers.
Designers.
Technology team members.
All of them take too much time. 
As per Inc42’s data, the top 28 Indian fintech startups spent INR 5,495.16 Crores in the financial year 2021-22 on marketing activities. (Source: https://inc42.com/features/top-28-indian-fintech-spent-672-mn-advertising-marketing-fy22/#:~:text=According%20to%20Inc42's%20data%2C%20the,promotions%20and%20other%20marketing%20activities.
That’s a LOT of money.
Vibe marketing is the AI-assisted evolution of how brands are being built — faster, cheaper, and a lot less manually. Think of it like replacing your 15-step approval workflow with one strong prompt and a decent eye for edits.
Ideation? Prompt it with ChatGPT.
Copy? Generate it with ChatGPT or Claude.
Design? AI-generated visuals using ChatGPT, Gemini, and even Kling AI. 
Campaign execution? Zapier says hi.
Analytics? tl;dv’s got the notes, Google Analytics got the data.
You’re still in the driver’s seat, but AI is now possibly your backseat strategist.

Sample Blog Content — How AI Marketing Works: Explained Simply for Founders (excerpt)
Source: https://www.uploaddigital.co/blogs/how-ai-marketing-works-explained-simply-for-founders
Key Highlights:
• Founders First: AI marketing isn’t just for enterprise teams; startups and lean B2B companies can benefit even more.
• Automation = Speed: From content to targeting, AI handles the grunt work so your team can focus on strategy.
• Data is the New Gut: No more guessing—AI helps you act on actual behavior, not hunches.
“Let’s be honest, ‘AI marketing’ sounds a little like sci‑fi jargon to most founders. Buzzwords like GPT, predictive analytics, and NLP get thrown around like confetti. But what does it actually do? And more importantly, how can it help you grow your B2B company without hiring a full‑blown marketing department?”
1) AI Doesn’t Replace Humans. It Amplifies Them — Write content drafts; personalize email sequences at scale; segment your CRM based on behavior; score leads; suggest keywords and SEO outlines.
2) AI Marketing = Personalization at Scale — Show different landing pages, trigger custom email flows, and prioritize outbound based on behavior.
3) It’s All About the Feedback Loop — Monitor CTRs, open rates, scroll depth; flag what’s underperforming; auto A/B test elements; adapt in real‑time.
4) You Don’t Need a Data Scientist to Get Started — Use no‑code tools (Jasper, Surfer SEO, ChatGPT, Zapier). Agencies help connect systems and monitor performance.
5) B2B Founders Are Already Seeing ROI — Examples include reduced CAC, doubled content output, and 5x lead conversion rates.
Final Thoughts — “An AI digital marketing agency isn’t a nice‑to‑have anymore. It’s your competitive edge.”

Sample Blog Content — Red Flags to Avoid When Selecting Digital Marketing Services (excerpt)
Source: https://www.uploaddigital.co/blogs/red-flags-to-avoid-when-selecting-digital-marketing-services
Introduction — Choosing the right digital marketing services can make or break your online presence. Knowing what to avoid will help you make an informed decision.
1) Lack of Transparency in Pricing and Strategies — Watch for vague pricing, hidden fees, and over‑promising without a plan.
2) No Proven Case Studies or Client Testimonials — Be wary of generic testimonials; ask for measurable results and references.
3) Guarantees of Instant or Unrealistic Results — SEO typically takes 3–6 months; PPC needs ongoing optimization; social growth depends on engagement.
4) Poor Communication and Lack of Regular Reporting — Ensure cadence, responsiveness, and metrics are clear.
5) One‑Size‑Fits‑All Approach — Strategies should be tailored to your industry, audience, and goals.
6) No Emphasis on Data‑Driven Decisions — Prefer analytics‑driven agencies tracking KPIs and ROI.
7) Outdated Marketing Techniques — Avoid black‑hat SEO or stale tactics; look for modern, AI‑informed approaches.
Conclusion — Partner with transparent, data‑driven teams that set realistic expectations.
