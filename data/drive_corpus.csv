Please type your answers in a different colour

Let’s now get an insight into your Individuality
Please be as descriptive as you'd like
Pour your heart out
The more stories you share - the better for us and you
This section is super vital for us to understand how you want to be perceived
Q1. How did your journey begin? Did you choose your profession or did it choose you?
*
Do share how your journey started, how did it evolve and how did you find your niche along the way.
Since my school days, I've always had conflicting ambitions of being an entrepreneur and pursuing a creative path. To find a balance, I studied Fashion Design and Information Technology at NIFT, New Delhi. Afterward, I worked as a lead designer for a company in Ahmedabad that specialized in designing Christmas decorations. However, I had to let go of that job when I married into a business family from Kolkata.
My new family owned a cosmetic manufacturing company that mainly focused on exporting their products. Even though my family became my priority, I never abandoned my ambitions. Luckily, with the support and expertise of my husband and father-in-law in the cosmetics industry, it felt like the perfect opportunity. In the initial days, it did not interest me as much, as any newcomer, I started with the regular tasks of communications, stream lining work etc. However, the Eureka moment was when, during a casual conversation, we started discussing the cluttered state of the skincare industry in India and realized that the hair care industry was being neglected. There weren’t any brands as such who catered to hair care market specifically. That's when we decided to create a brand that would address this gap in the market and provide customers with the highest quality products.
From that point on, I took charge of conceptualizing the product range, conducting market research, aesthetics and diving into various aspects of the business. Every day brought new challenges, lessons and experiences, and still does as that's what being a founder is all about. So, in a way, the profession chose me, but it allows me to fulfil my entrepreneurial aspirations while indulging my creativity.
Q2. Professionally, how do you want to be perceived?
*
Note: There can be more than 1 answer.
{ Example - You might want to be perceived as a sales leader/ investor/entrepreneur etc.}
Please elaborate as to what trait of your personality made you good at your profession {Example - you might be good at convincing people, hence you chose sales. Or you might be good with words and write on your personal time hence you wanted to become a writer} Feel free to add real life examples, stories and incidents. We are eager to hear.
Being perceived as an entrepreneur is important to me because it reflects my passion for organizing various aspects of the business personally. I prefer to be a part of every detail personally, whether it's developing new product ideas, brainstorming on day to day creatives, marketing strategies, or checking operational processes. By keeping myself involved in these areas, as it helps me understand our strengths and make informed decisions that contribute to its success.
I strongly believe in the power of collaboration and value the input of my team members. While I may be responsible for overseeing the business, I recognize the importance of gathering insights and perspectives from others. I actively encourage my team to share their suggestions, ideas, and concerns, and maintain an environment of open communication and innovation. It is the team, that can collectively drive the growth and development of the business.
Q3. During your professional tenure, can you share some memorable incidents with the people or teams you have worked with?
*
This can be a conversation or experience with someone in particular (a founder, colleague, family member, mentor) that left an impact in you
Do share stories, we love to read :)
There are days filled with triumphs and days that bring demotivation. On one of those particularly disheartening days, my husband, Ashish, shared an inspiring story about my father-in-law. He reminded me of how my father-in-law started his cosmetic manufacturing venture during a time when advertising budgets were limited, marketing as we know it today was virtually nonexistent, and the internet was still a distant concept. Despite these challenges, he managed to establish a successful brand named Sofia within a span of five years. This achievement was driven by the exceptional quality of the products and the power of word-of-mouth publicity and of course perseverance.
In today's digital age, we often find ourselves seeking instant results and immediate gratification, forgetting the value of time in sustainable growth. Ashish reminded me of this important lesson. While we may have already gained brand recognition within a relatively short span of two years, building a solid business requires much more time and effort.
This served as a powerful reminder that success is not always achieved overnight, especially in the case of entrepreneurship. It takes perseverance, dedication, and the willingness to invest in the long-term vision. By focusing on consistently delivering quality products, building trust which becomes a habit, we can lay the foundation for lasting success.
So, despite the instant results and the rapid pace of digital marketing, one must not forget the significance of patience and allowing time for our business to evolve and mature.
Q4. What has been your biggest takeaway from failures or “learnings from things that didn't work out”?
*
Write instances from a point of view of sharing your learnings with the next generation or upcoming professional
It can be a struggle you faced in your personal or professional life, and how you overcame it
Or, it can be any mistakes you made in your life, or work and the lessons you learnt along the way
If they followed these they will not make the same mistakes and reach to their goals faster
1. As an entrepreneur and an Indian woman, One of the most significant takeaways for me is that finding a balance between your professional and personal life is crucial. It's easy to get consumed by your entrepreneurial pursuits, especially when you're driven and passionate about what you do. However, it's essential to understand that your family and personal life should never be replaced, regardless of how successful you become. Time management plays a key role in achieving this balance. You need to prioritize and allocate time for both your business and your family. And most importantly, learn to delegate. As entrepreneurs, we want to do everything ourselves, but after a point you must trust our team and start delegating.
2. Like any new project, I faced some initial problems. I had chosen a bottle, but soon realized that many other brands were using the same one. I really wanted our product to stand out and have its own unique identity. So, after discussing it with my team, we decided to create our own custom bottle design and color that would only be associated with our brand. It was a tough decision because it meant more expenses, delays, and uncertainty about how people would react to the new design. However, our new bottles turned out fantastic and they are truly one-of-a-kind.
But that wasn't the end of it. We had to redo all our labels because we weren't satisfied with the quality, and the same thing happened with our dispensers. At every step, there was disappointment. It felt like no matter how hard I tried, I couldn't get things perfect. It took a lot of time and caused significant delays. But we are proud of our our packaging as much as our product quality.
3. Mistakes are not setbacks but learnings. There are no shortcuts or guarantees to reaching your goals faster without experiencing setbacks. Experience is often the best teacher. While theoretical knowledge is valuable, practical application and learning on the job are even more important. Don't be afraid to take risks, try new things, and learn from the outcomes. We took the risk of launching a hair care range which are science backed at a time where the Fad was all natural and ayurvedic. But we do not regret the risk taken as our products are superior in quality and efficacy.
Q5.  Do you have a contradictory opinion or a different perspective on a specific topic?
Based on your experiences and observations, we want to know what you believe the world needs less of and more of
Are there any cultural norms or traditions that you strongly disagree with?
What we truly need more of are real people and fewer virtual ones. In a world that seems more connected yet lonelier than ever, we need to prioritize real people and the nourishment they bring to our lives.
Q6. What does a day in your life look like?
*
List down the activities or tasks you typically follow in your daily routine
This can be your daily exercise routine, general overview of your day, or activities or steps you typically follow throughout the day to achieve a specific task.
Here's a general overview of how my day unfolds:
Mornings: I start my day by sending the children to school. Afterward, a walk and then I enjoy a cup of tea with breakfast. This quiet moment with tea has become a sort of morning therapy for me.
Work Mode: I usually begin work early at the office and remain focused on my tasks until the afternoon. This period is dedicated to work-related activities.
Afternoons: I wrap up work just before the children come back from school..
Other Tasks and Errands: After the children are back, I have a list of other tasks and errands to attend to. I usually divide this list for the week, so each day has its designated set of responsibilities. I like to plan ahead and organise.
Evenings: During the evenings, I assist the children with their studies and and various extracurricular activities. It's important to me that they have a well-rounded education and pursue their interests outside of academics.
Leisure Time: Late evenings are reserved for leisure activities, outings, or simply spending  time with my family and friends.
Before Bedtime: Before going to sleep, I like to spend an hour watching Netflix with my husband. That’s my me-time and  entertainment before we call it a day.
That's a general overview of the activities and tasks I typically follow in my daily routine. Of course, there may be variations and occasional changes depending on specific circumstances, but this provides a snapshot of how my day unfolds on a regular basis. Certainly! In the midst of juggling multiple responsibilities and activities throughout the day, effective time management and coordination play a crucial role in ensuring everything runs smoothly.
Q7. Have you come across a specific situation or point that you find highly relatable?
*
This is to establish a relatable connection with your audience.
This can be a common challenge, an everyday occurrence, or a relatable observation that resonates with majority of the people
This can also be depicted as a meme, tailored to your industry to resonate with your audience
One relatable situation from my interactions with others is the struggle to stay focused in the digital world.
In today's fast-paced digital age, maintaining focus can be quite challenging. With smartphones buzzing, notifications popping up, and a constant influx of information, it's easy to get side tracked. It's like trying to concentrate on one thing while a whole carnival of distractions is going on around you! The struggle to stay focused amidst all the distractions is real. In addition to the digital noise we face, there's another major challenge – the endless online courses and WhatsApp groups.
But with so much valuable content at our fingertips, it's easy to get overwhelmed. I often find myself tempted to enrol in every course or join every WhatsApp group related to my industry. Before I know it, my focus starts to waver, and I'm pulled in multiple directions. Not to forget the FOMO and comparisions of success and failures with your own business which work as stress aggregators..
As an entrepreneur, time is our most precious asset, and we need to use it wisely. So, striking a balance becomes crucial. Instead of succumbing to the fear of missing out, I've learned to prioritize and select only a few groups that align with my goals. Not only that, one has to understand that every journey is different, everyone’s timeline is different and you cannot be drawn to make decisions based on someone else’s journey. Yes, take ideas and inspiration, only where applicable but take decisions that comply to your business specifically.
Being part of supportive WhatsApp groups can be fantastic, but it's also essential to set boundaries. I allocate specific times for engaging in these groups to avoid getting lost in them.
It’s okay to not do all things. Focus on the learning and networking opportunities that truly add value to your entrepreneurial journey. Stay disciplined and mindful of your time, and you'll harness the power of these resources without letting them overwhelm you.
Embracing the abundance of knowledge and connections, while also taming the overwhelming distractions. As start-up entrepreneurs, we're all navigating this crazy journey together! Let's stay focused, learn smart, and thrive in the midst of it all!

Your Domain Expertise
This section is super vital for us to delve into the depths of your expertise.
Please provide a descriptive account of your expertise for us to gain a comprehensive understanding of your authority and educational value.
Provide a detailed overview of the subject matter you specialize in.
Along with your knowledge, feel free to include actionable tips or best practices that can benefit others in your field.
If applicable, include any analytical reports, research findings, or data-driven insights that support your expertise.
I am a NIFT graduate and one of y strength lies in the  comprehensive understanding of design principles, ability to think creatively, and the practical experience in applying these skills to various domains, such as packaging, advertising, and social media. In today's digital age, social media plays a crucial role in marketing and brand communication. Hence, design and visuals are extremely important. Of course, I have a very competent team to create and supervise the above but my personal education in the same gives us an upper hand to get the aesthetics right.
When it comes to creating and developing products, I've got some real hands-on experience. Let me tell you, during those two years of research we did before launching our hair care line, I learned a ton. I got to dive deep into different ingredients, chemicals, and their purposes, and how they all come together to make effective formulations. Honestly, there's nothing quite like learning by doing. Practical experience is where it's at – it's definitive, faster, and more focused.
This is just one part of brand building. As a founder one must have knowledge in every field but it’s not practically feasible to have extensive education in each. Thanks to the number of short courses that help entrepreneurs get quicker understanding in most fields. I too, have done one of these short term D2C growth courses to gain a better insight on it.

Long-answer text
Well for me my domain knowledge comes from two very distinct phases of my life. The first would be my education and work experience thereafter as a designer which has been my expertise with the line. From the very onset of packaging and design, I had a vision which proved to be a great brief for our design team to collaborate and design the entire line of products – packaging, logo, marketing collaterals, etc all of it. I always knew I wanted to create a brand that would define ‘attainable luxury’. It had to look and feel a certain way for people to have the best possible experience. Of course the products had to perform no matter what, but the entire brand had to resonate a design language which would be different from the rest. And being a digital first business, there is no excuse not to upskill yourself. The times are constantly changing and so are the tools, design language – There are so many platforms and courses to do to keep oneself up to date with the times. The second phase of my domain would be through getting into the family business as cosmetic manufacturers.  Herein from product development to an in depth understanding of all the protocols and processes to be followed to take a product from the drawing table, to our consumers. Being manufacturers ourself, we have the strength of experience, knowledge and a vast network that I have always played to my strength at The Earth Collective. This domain a collective strength for all of us.
One specific time where with the support of all our team members when we were able to play to our strength was the launch of our Hair Density Tonic. Amidst lockdown after lockdown in the pandemic we were able to design, manufacture and launch this product which was a need of the hour with the excessive post-covid hair fall which so many customers complained to us about. We were clear on the product and its objective, sourced the best of ingredients, despite all logistical challenges, designed the product to look distinct and worked on a string communication strategy, finally manufactured the product and got it to the audience to be able to solve their hair concern. This was one of our very successful launches and this is where I feel my expertise came to play at the right place, at the right time.

Q11. What is your leadership philosophy?
*
Everyone has a way of getting things done, what is yours?
Feel free to share tips and advice from your professional experience to help others solve problems and achieve their goals ( strategies and approaches that have worked for you)
My leadership philosophy is all about working as a team. It’s about trusting and delegating to my team, welcoming their ideas and suggestions, and understanding that mistakes happen. I believe in empowering my team members, giving them the freedom to make decisions and take ownership. I value open communication, knowing that great ideas can come from anyone. When mistakes occur, I focus on finding solutions and ensuring that they are not repeated, excusing minor errors and having a supportive environment. By following this philosophy, I aim to create a positive and motivated team that can achieve great things together. In addition, I want my team to see me as a fellow team member rather than fearing me as their employer. Of course, they must and do update me every moment on everything, small or big and every task must have an approval from me. At the same time, I believe in a supportive and approachable relationship where open dialogue, trust, and mutual respect are valued. I believe that when team members feel comfortable approaching me, it fosters a healthier work environment that promotes innovation and growth.
According to my perspective, open communication is the best approach to problem-solving. Keeping a problem hidden only exacerbates it, whereas involving a small group of individuals with a calm mindset can lead to quicker resolutions. By openly discussing and addressing the issue, we can gather different perspectives, pool our collective knowledge, and find effective solutions more efficiently.
In the beginning, I would often find myself in panic mode when facing teething issues like Facebook blocks or website and technical problems. It would sometimes cause delays in finding solutions because my follow-ups were rushed. However, I've come to realize that it's important to maintain a calm approach when solving problems. By focusing on calmly letting the work force resolve the issue first and then discussing it with the team to understand its occurrence, we can actually speed up the process of finding solutions.
Q12. Can you provide examples of the problems you currently face in your domain, and how a different category/strategy can offer effective solutions?
*
This is to address the misconceptions, guide audience away from common mistakes, and encourage them adopt innovative solutions.
You can talk about some prevalent industry myths or misconceptions that often misleads your industry peers
Some common mistakes that people tend to make in your industry/niche
Shortcomings or limitations of the old category within your niche, and how the new category can provide superior solutions
Long-answer text
With the expansion of D2C brand in India, we have seen a surge of so many personal care brands. This growth has been phenomenal for new brands because customers have shown a lot of trust and acceptance towards trying our newer, Indian, homegrown products. We have had so much support from platforms like Meta, Google, Instagram to grow our customer database, Ecommerce platforms that have helped us reach their database and content creators who have helped promote our brands to their audience. We have had so many opportunities to explore. But of course everything comes with its benefits and some drawbacks as well. Here are some examples of aspects we can explore to make our industry more accommodative to newer brands and also help build protocols and trust.
Somewhere along the line of growing digitally, we tend to forget about an audience that is more offline. Hence doing exhibitions, exploring retail shelf space etc is so important. But when it comes to shelf space, the costs and credit  involved is at times very high for start-up brands to explore.
Content creators started out an organic journey. And of course, they had the aim to make it viable as a profession to make ends meet and grow. Growth is something we all strive for. But earlier most of them were so concentrated on working with homegrown brands at commercials that work out mutually. Now, with all the conglomerates with big pockets tying up with them, commercials become very high. Especially for brands that are bootstrapped. So, I surely feel this is one aspect which will have a certain disparity going forward
Another aspect in this industry is ‘following a trend’ – this comes in the form of a product or an ingredient. While that might surely work out for some people with a specific concern or aim, but not everything is for everyone. And this is truly something which I feel very strongly about. We should be very mindful of what we use on our skin or hair or body and not just go by what’s trending.
Less is more is something which I feel very less brands are getting right. Now days following trends and creators people are buying and using more than what they need. This is something which not only confuses the audience but also creates a sense of ‘need’ which isn’t truly justified. Sometimes one needs just one product or two to do the trick and not an elaborate 7-step ritual
Another thing that I feel might not be the best strategy is ‘doing it all’. Now days, most brands have multiple categories and product lines. This is something which I feel shifts focus and which is why at TEC when we began we started off with our Tagline as The Hair Specialist so that at no point along this journey do we every forget or focus as a brand that only focuses on scalp and hair care
Current affairs and Interests
This section is important to understand your point of view professional/personal on current affairs
Q13. What are a few issues that you think are important and not spoken about enough?
*
Please elaborate on one or more personal experiences of why this has meaning to you.
Ex- Mental health, women empowerment, Gender pay parity, recession, changing work culture
Have you personally encountered these issues?
Even if not if you have any indirect encounter with such issues. Please share some examples, or solutions to overcome such circumstances
Changing work culture: I totally understand the perks of working-from-home culture but I do not prefer this way of work.  It is distracting, time consuming, every task takes multiple rounds of coordination, miscommunication…You can’t compare how being physically present in the office can make things more efficient. The office vibe, discussions, and overall atmosphere really contribute to better teamwork and communication. You just can't beat those spontaneous interactions, brainstorming sessions, and that feeling of being part of a company. Personally, I believe working from the office is more productive any day. A similar issue is the work life balance. Although I understand and completely agree with the importance of work-life balance and setting boundaries. I do not agree with going on a complete OFF mode in the name of a work life balance if a there is an important event, good/bad occurs. On a weekend, or at night if an urgent task come up, it's crucial to address them promptly, no matter if it's the weekend or not. It's all about finding that sweet spot between personal life and work commitments. Good communication, clear expectations, and a bit of flexibility go a long way in dealing with these situations. Different people and companies have their own approaches, so having open discussions and finding common ground is key. Ultimately, it's about getting things done on time while still respecting personal time.
Q14. What is something that intrigues you in today’s time the most?
*
You can share your take on what's trending now. Example -web3, crypto, AI or home bakers?
You can either share direct resources with your audience, or breakdown the content in the form of a listicle
I find AI really intriguing. It's all about creating intelligent machines that can think and learn like humans. What's amazing is how AI can revolutionize different aspects of our lives. It can make things more efficient, improve decision-making, and even personalize experiences to some extent. The ability of AI systems to process huge amounts of data and learn from it is mind-blowing. Of course, while AI is intriguing, the human touch and review remain essential. AI may seem a little intimidating, but it's crucial for us to embrace technology and its potential. I think, while AI can automate certain tasks, human oversight and judgment are still necessary. We should see AI as a tool that enhances our capabilities rather than replacing us. It's about finding the right balance and leveraging technology to our advantage.
Q15. In the last 6 months, what was something that really intrigued you and you wanted to share your opinion on?
*
You can share something as recent as last week also. It could be a trend, development, or any topic that has caught your attention
If applicable, we would love to hear your analysis on what you believe will influence your domain in the future.
Long-answer text
In our industry, especially in the digital space, change is always going to be constant, one that we need to monitor day to day. Some things that have grabbed my attention in the last 6 months are:
Growth of celebrity endorsed brands: What began maybe with Kylie Jenner in the states and now to Deepika’s line, celebrity brands are taking off very well. The latest being Rare Beauty launching in India shows how much these brands have created such a space in the Indian Markets, despite such high price points.  And this is something which surely proves to be quite a competition for us to watch out for as it will be a huge influence in our market
Change in RBI guidelines and Policies for Recurring Payments: I think all business owners would agree with me here that sometimes these changes really impact our day to day functioning. While we have had tremendous support for the growth is MSMEs but we need to get the global platforms also involved that very basic issues can be resolved quickly
Focus on Scalp Care: This is something which I see picking up more and more as each quarter passes with new brands and new products launching that focus on scalp just as much as skin. And this is something which we at The Earth Collective have been striving to do.
Q16. What are a few additional topics that you would like to talk about
*
(Mention minimum 2-3 topics)
Travel: Traveling for me is the ultimate way to unwind, learn new things, and spend quality time with myself and my loved ones. It's like stepping into a carefree zone, a break  from responsibilities, a break from the mundane routine of everyday life. Exploring different cultures, trying local cuisine, and witnessing breathtaking sights opens my mind to a whole new level of  appreciation for the world we live in. Each journey feels like a new experience. The experiences gained and the memories created during my travels are incredibly precious and timeless leaving an everlasting impact on my soul. From a lazy holiday on a beach to trekking through nature or wandering on city streets, every trip leaves me rejuvenated. So, I embrace the excitement of the unknown, and cherish the moments that make me feel alive.
Indian women and career: Indian women starting their careers later in life is a valid and commendable choice, driven by individual priorities and responsibilities. Many women choose to prioritize their families and children during their early years, finding fulfillment in dedicating time and attention to their loved ones. This decision doesn't diminish their capabilities or ambitions; rather, it reflects the understanding that life has different phases, each with unique demands and rewards. Choosing to start a career later doesn't mean that these women are any less capable or ambitious. It simply reflects their individual priorities and the understanding that there are different phases of life, each with its unique demands and rewards. The experiences and skills gained while raising a family can be invaluable in the workplace as well, fostering qualities like patience, empathy, and multitasking abilities.  It's essential to challenge traditional notions of timelines and success, recognizing that life is not a race with predefined milestones. Women have the right to decide whether they want to embark on a profession journey, and when they want to embark on their professional journey, and there is no ""right"" or ""wrong"" age to start. What matters is that women are encouraged to make choices that align with their passions and goals.
As society becomes more accepting and supportive of diverse paths, organizations recognize the value of a varied workforce and accommodate different life choices. By empowering women to make decisions aligned with their passions and goals, we can create a more inclusive and equal society, where individuals are valued for their contributions, irrespective of the timing of their career start. Let's celebrate the freedom of choice and encourage women to pursue their dreams whenever they feel it's right for them.

Scene 1: about 10 seconds
A car is driving into a dark tunnel / cave with the headlight on. After a few seconds it faces a wall and screeches to halt and struggles to take a U turn. (this is a subliminal simulation of how urologists search for their target using probes, during live surgery. It is stressful, time consuming process like driving into a system of caves)
A caption appears “Kidney stone surgeries need not feel like this any more”
Scene 2: 20 seconds
A urologist and an assistant are sitting and looking at a screen that shows 3D rendering of the Kidneys, provided by Urologiq. They interact with it, discuss with each other and make notes. It's quite apparent that they are planning for the upcoming stone surgery.
Captions / voiceover : Urologiq provides urologists with intricate details of the individual patient's kidneys and the stones for a successful pre-planning of the treatment.
Scene 3: 20 seconds
Urologist and assistant performing surgery and an animation of kidney stones getting shattered and taken away by the instruments. Ends with a smiling patient after surgery"
C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\drive_export\takeout-20250828T085433Z-1-001\Takeout\Drive\Search functionality corrections.docx,"Search on website:
The backend has now been changed to search both tags and titles of the website.  Current website observations:
Challenges with corrections needed:
Searching for terms like Annual report bring up these errors:
Remove “We are funded by B&G. If you want to consider funding email us” This was an old section that is hidden and needs to be removed (screenshot below)
Need the coding such that the search shows the annual report and allows to click on the annual report section directly instead of a long scroll on the about us page
Partner names are not searchable
If the search function is searching for content on other pages, it should search for it on the expedition page too. A search for partner name “Teach for Nigeria”, “Youthtopia” and others is showing a “not found” response. Please resolve. Screenshot below:
Solo expedition:
Shows up thank you page – this needs to be hidden from search
Shows up a blank section -  this needs to be hidden from search – expedition solo back
What does women emerging do:
This shows up search of articles from WE Hub.
Blogs would need a better tagging with WE updates, or WE to ensure that the expedition blogs and explorer reflections show up
Other errors:
https://womenemerging.org/end-of-the-year-reflections-with-julia-middleton-founder-women-emerging/ link shows 404 error
Search on Julia Middleton doesn't bring up her biog. Instead it offers a whole number of podcasts. As a visitor, that's not what I want. Should offer me her biog.
Same on Funmi. Goes to the About Us page, so if I know to scroll down I might get to it... but if not, then it doesn't help.
When  I search on WE Hub in the search bar (ie, I missed the navigation title), it offers me the privacy policy. Why?
If I search on core values, it does find them but very very low in the search results.
If I search on History of WE, it prioritises podcasts, which is not what I'm looking for. It should go to the top level pages first.
If I search on WE Mission, again, it prioritises podcasts. Should offer me about us page
If I search on Who funds WE, it says it doesn't have any information about this. This needs to change, somehow, as funders will for sure want to see who else is funding us.
Additional changes:
All hidden sections should be hidden from search
All titles should be prioritised for search, so that keywords like partners, expedition sectors (teachers, changemakers etc) show up, which are not currently showing
Given that content is prioritised, it should show content from group expedition sub-pages as well, so that search with partner names show results
Keywords searched for:
Annual report
Group expedition
Solo expedition
Themed solo expedition
Expedition
What is an expedition
How to sign up for an expedition
Funding Women Emerging
Expedition partner
What does women emerging do

Expedition for teachers
Expedition for changemakers
Line items from June thread - From Omodara:
Plugins we would add to the WE Hub (from the plug in link) https://gamipress.com/add-ons/
Progress: shows out users their progress of completion of any achievement
Progress map: Adds interactive achievement and ranks progress maps on site - This is only relevant if your tasks are sequential like step 1, 2, 3
Expirations: Sets an expiration date to completion of requirements on the WE Hub
Restrict content: To gate content - This is not the feature that WE is looking for. “Restrict Content gives you the ability to configure several restrictions to any post or page until user completes all the requirements specified.” 

This is not gating based on number of pieces consumed. That feature is already configured
Front end reports: Reports for users on the front end to display their progress to them
They can see their progress
Mark as Completed: Allows users to mark requirements as completed manually

Please also refer to the end of the email, where I have added the pending list of content/line items that is required so we can stay on track with the planned timeline.
i.      Become an explorer - since this was not in design and we were under the impression that it leads to the LMS, this was not designed. As we received the content document on 17th April and it now has content, we would need clarity on where the content is going. Spoke over Whatsapp. Hope that gives clarity. Also, are you an explorer on the group expedition page was going to LMS – I clarified this over the call this week as well and also over WhatsApp when LMS was not to be added. Become an explorer on the WE Hub page was always a subpage and not going to the LMS. Thanks for the clarity, acknowledged on the previous email. As this page was not part of the wireframes, design, or any other feedback, we will be happy to pick this up post the testing link is live for your team, and we aim to wrap up before the launch since you mentioned it is required.
ii.      Contribute to the Hub - thanks for sending this, this is a part of the phase 2 of the project, hence the functionality will be picked up post going live (launch) Spoke over Whatsapp. Hope that gives clarity.

ii.      Manisha
iii.      Paula
iv.      Shurti
v.      Valerie
2.            For the featured section on the WE Hub, we would like to feature Valerie’s blog - Noted
3.            For these 5 blogs, for the recommended section, we would like other Guides tips to be featured and nothing else. - this can happen only we add the “Guide tips” as a tag. Please confirm this. Once confirmed and we add tags, 2 blogs with the same tag will be visible in the bottom. Tags have been added in the document below as well as the blogs. If there are further questions, call me.  Noted with thanks.
2.            At the time of launch we would like to gate the below two things:
Ask AI – show the page, but the visitor cannot ask the question to AI without signing in
If that’s leading, I’m in. – the free version of the book can be downloaded only by a subscriber. So, when someone clicks on read for free, it should give a pop up for sign up for the hub.
The gated content is a part of the phase 2 of the project, hence the functionality will be picked up post going live (launch). You can refer to the same here. Additionally, confirming that we discussed over a phone call about books functionality and pages on WE Hub to be implemented post go live as there was a misunderstanding about “audio books” and “books” during design and development discussions in the initial stages. Yes gated content is part of phase 2 and hence we are not requesting everything to be gated. We are only asking for specific sections to be gated. Additionally, for the books we had spoken over a call, specifically about If that’s leading, I’m in having a different design and 2 CTAs v/s the other books having only 1 CTA and this was discussed for phase 1 go live and not phase 2. Happy to discuss over a call if required. If all the books are a challenge, than let’s get to just 1 which is this book. Post our WhatsApp exchange on 9th April, I had given you a call after checking internally with the team about the feasibility of adding the books section. I had mentioned that this wouldn’t be possible before the launch, and while I did say we could try, it was never confirmed as something we’d be able to include it before launch. Even if limited to one book, the gated functionality requires backend implementation that isn’t in place yet and was always meant to be part of Phase 2. I do acknowledge that this wasn’t put down over email earlier, and I understand how that may have caused confusion — happy to jump on a call if you’d like to walk through it again. Hope this helps clarify things.

While I understand the ask is limited to one book, the gated content functionality – even on a single page – involves a larger implementation at the backend, which we are not in a position to complete pre-launch. Same for the AI Page.
3.            I had mentioned a few design changes as below:
About us Banner should be replicated on the WE Hub landing page
The infinity sign with hands coming out from it should be used on the sign in and sign-up page of the WE Hub
Noted both the points, both will be implemented

Working Out & Sweaty Scalp
Sweating it out is great for your mind, body and soul. But the story is a little different when it comes to hair care.
Sweat deposits on the scalp and clogs the pores. It can even make hair limp and leave a funny smell. Studies have also shown that when sweat mixes with other bacteria, it can cause fungal and bacterial infections, harm the hair follicles, decelerate hair growth, and negatively affect the texture of your hair.  Hence, hair wash after a workout is a must!

Summary
In April, we published 5 blog posts around the theme ""Hair Care Tips"", focusing on keywords like:
“Curly hair routine for beginners,” “pre-wash oil treatments,” “right shampoo for curly hair,” “leave-in
conditioners,” and “definition gel.”
Each keyword was used 5–10 times per blog to improve visibility in search results.
Organic traffic is currently at 175 users — a good starting point, as SEO typically takes a few months to show
significant growth.
145 keywords are already ranking for XO Curls. This number is expected to increase as the blog content gains
traction and starts ranking for common hair care searches.
Other sources, like paid ads and untracked traffic, are contributing an additional 2,000+ visitors, which
supports overall brand exposure.
 Note: SEO is a long-term strategy — growth will be gradual, but consistent content and optimization will lead to
stronger results in the coming months.

ACF Photo Gallery Field :
The ACF Photo Gallery Field is a WordPress plugin that extends Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) to let you add photo galleries to posts or pages. It stores images as post metadata and provides a helper function acf_photo_gallery(ACF_FIELD_NAME, POST_ID) to retrieve image data (like title, caption, URL, etc.) as an array. You can display the gallery using any front-end framework (e.g., Bootstrap). It also supports extra image fields, custom captions, and REST API integration.
Advanced Custom Fields (ACF®) :
Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) enhances WordPress by letting you add custom fields to posts, pages, users, and more—without writing code. Using its visual field builder, you can easily define structured content (like text, images, or repeaters). These fields can be displayed in your theme using simple PHP functions like get_field(). ACF Pro adds advanced features like repeaters, flexible layouts, galleries, and custom blocks for Gutenberg. It helps developers and content creators manage data-rich sites efficiently.
Advanced Custom Fields Multilingual :
This ACFML glue plugin connects Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) with WPML (WordPress Multilingual Plugin), making it easy to translate custom fields into multiple languages. It ensures that content created with ACF—like text, images, repeaters, and flexible content—is recognized and translatable by WPML’s interface. With this plugin, you can smoothly manage multilingual content across all ACF field types without manual duplication or custom code.
Better Search Replace :
Better Search Replace is a WordPress plugin designed to help you safely search and replace text or URLs in your database, which is especially useful when migrating a site to a new domain or server.

It’s built on the open-source Search Replace DB script but optimized to use WordPress's native database functions for better compatibility.

Contact Form 7 Multilingual :

Country & Phone Field Contact Form 7 :
Country & Phone Field Contact Form 7 is an add-on for Contact Form 7 that adds two new field types: a country drop-down with flags and a phone number field with country code extensions. Once installed, you can use the form tags country drop-down and phone number in your CF7 forms. It requires Contact Form 7 to function and enhances forms with intuitive international phone and country selection.
Date Time Picker for Contact Form 7 :
Date Time Picker for Contact Form 7 enhances text fields by turning them into date, time, or datetime pickers using specific CSS classes. You simply add the class walcf7-datepicker, walcf7-timepicker, or walcf7-datetimepicker to a Contact Form 7 text field. The plugin then automatically loads the appropriate picker. The Pro version offers advanced options like disabling past dates, limiting date/time ranges, choosing 12h or 24h formats, WPML compatibility, and performance optimizations.
Duplicate Page :
Duplicate Page is a plugin that lets you easily clone posts, pages, and custom post types in WordPress with a single click. Once activated, you can configure its settings to choose the default status (draft, published, etc.) and behavior of the duplicated content.

MailChimp Multilingual :
MailChimp Multilingual is a WPML integration plugin that makes it easy to translate content from the MailChimp for WordPress plugin.

This plugin installs the Meta Pixel on your site to track key user actions like Lead, ViewContent, AddToCart, InitiateCheckout, and Purchase. It also supports the Conversions API, which sends data directly to Meta (Facebook/Instagram) for more accurate tracking, better ad targeting, and lower advertising costs. Using both Pixel and the API improves measurement and performance of your Meta ads.

Plugins
ACF Photo Gallery Field :
The ACF Photo Gallery Field is a WordPress plugin that extends Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) to let you add photo galleries to posts or pages. It stores images as post metadata and provides a helper function acf_photo_gallery(ACF_FIELD_NAME, POST_ID) to retrieve image data (like title, caption, URL, etc.) as an array. You can display the gallery using any front-end framework (e.g., Bootstrap). It also supports extra image fields, custom captions, and REST API integration.
Advanced Custom Fields (ACF®) :
Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) enhances WordPress by letting you add custom fields to posts, pages, users, and more—without writing code. Using its visual field builder, you can easily define structured content (like text, images, or repeaters). These fields can be displayed in your theme using simple PHP functions like get_field(). ACF Pro adds advanced features like repeaters, flexible layouts, galleries, and custom blocks for Gutenberg. It helps developers and content creators manage data-rich sites efficiently.
Advanced Custom Fields Multilingual :
This ACFML glue plugin connects Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) with WPML (WordPress Multilingual Plugin), making it easy to translate custom fields into multiple languages. It ensures that content created with ACF—like text, images, repeaters, and flexible content—is recognized and translatable by WPML’s interface. With this plugin, you can smoothly manage multilingual content across all ACF field types without manual duplication or custom code.
All-in-One WP Migration and Backup:
All-in-One WP Migration works by allowing you to export your entire WordPress website—including the database, media files, plugins, and themes—into a single .wpress file with just one click. You then install the plugin on the destination site and simply drag and drop the file to import and fully restore your website. The process is designed to be seamless, requiring no technical skills and causing no downtime during migration.
All-in-One WP Migration Unlimited Extension:
The All-in-One WP Migration Unlimited Extension is a premium add-on that removes the upload and export size limits imposed in the free version of the plugin. With this extension, you can migrate websites of any size, whether it’s a small blog or a large enterprise portal. It’s especially useful for users with heavy media libraries, large databases, or complex WordPress setups, and it works seamlessly with the core plugin to ensure fast, reliable, and unrestricted migration or backup operations.
Classic Editor :
The Classic Editor plugin disables the Gutenberg block editor and restores the old WordPress editor (TinyMCE). It lets admins set the default editor and allows users to choose per post. It supports legacy plugins and meta boxes, ensuring a consistent editing experience.
Classic Widgets :
The Classic Widgets plugin restores the old WordPress widget interface, disabling the block-based widget editor. When activated, it brings back the classic widget settings screen for classic themes, with no extra setup needed. Just enable or disable the plugin to switch widget interfaces.
Contact Form 7 :
Contact Form 7 is a free and open-source WordPress plugin that lets you create and manage contact forms easily. It uses a modular architecture and custom validation system. The plugin doesn’t store user data or use cookies by default, but optional integrations (like reCAPTCHA or Stripe) may handle personal data. It’s privacy-conscious, flexible, and widely supported by a large community.
Contact Form 7 – Dynamic Text Extension :
Contact Form 7 – Dynamic Text Extension (DTX) enhances Contact Form 7 by allowing you to pre-fill form fields dynamically using shortcodes. It supports auto-populating data like post titles, user info, URLs, cookies, custom fields, and more. You can set dynamic values, placeholders, and even make fields read-only or obfuscated for privacy. It’s also cache-friendly, supports client-side rendering, and allows custom shortcodes for full flexibility. DTX makes Contact Form 7 smarter and more personalized for users and site data.
Contact Form 7 Multilingual :
Contact Form 7 Multilingual is a WPML add-on that allows you to translate Contact Form 7 forms without creating separate forms for each language. You build the form once in CF7, and then use WPML to manage translations, keeping the structure intact and simplifying multilingual form management.
Contact Form 7 Database Addon – CFDB7 :
CFDB7 is a plugin that automatically saves Contact Form 7 submissions to your WordPress database with no setup required. It stores all form entries in a single table and allows you to view, export (CSV/PDF), or import (CSV) data. It also offers developer-friendly features, email testing tools, and optional pro add-ons like Excel export, external DB connection, drag & drop uploads, and popup messages for enhanced form interaction.
Converter for Media:
Converter for Media is an image optimization plugin that converts your JPEG, PNG, and GIF files to modern WebP and AVIF formats, reducing file size and speeding up your website. With one click, it optimizes your entire Media Library, and all new images are converted automatically. The PRO version adds AVIF support, even smaller file sizes, and compatibility with theme and plugin images — all while ensuring full browser support and no changes to your original files.
Country & Phone Field Contact Form 7 :
Country & Phone Field Contact Form 7 is an add-on for Contact Form 7 that adds two new field types: a country drop-down with flags and a phone number field with country code extensions. Once installed, you can use the form tags country drop-down and phone number in your CF7 forms. It requires Contact Form 7 to function and enhances forms with intuitive international phone and country selection.
Date Time Picker for Contact Form 7 :
Date Time Picker for Contact Form 7 enhances text fields by turning them into date, time, or datetime pickers using specific CSS classes. You simply add the class walcf7-datepicker, walcf7-timepicker, or walcf7-datetimepicker to a Contact Form 7 text field. The plugin then automatically loads the appropriate picker. The Pro version offers advanced options like disabling past dates, limiting date/time ranges, choosing 12h or 24h formats, WPML compatibility, and performance optimizations.
Duplicate Page :
Duplicate Page is a plugin that lets you easily clone posts, pages, and custom post types in WordPress with a single click. Once activated, you can configure its settings to choose the default status (draft, published, etc.) and behavior of the duplicated content. After setup, clicking the ""Duplicate This"" link creates a copy based on your preferences. The Pro version adds advanced options like user role control, custom link titles, post prefix/suffix, redirect options, and more customization features.

You can insert codes site-wide or on specific pages, place them in the <head> or <body>, and control visibility by location or privacy compliance. It auto-detects eCommerce plugins to track conversions and avoids code loss during theme or plugin updates.

27image selection 
guidelines
1. For any and all of the image categories, ensure the image conveys emotions strongly. The gifts, flowers, cakes  
     should become an extension of their happy moments.
2. Avoid posed photographs. Candid images look natural and stimulates effortless emotions.
3. Clean, decluttered photos with lots of negative space generally get more engagement than ‘busy’ photos. Also i     
     suggest to look for images following rule of thirds.
4. Look for images that are similar in tone and colour of the brand. It helps in maintaining consistency across.

social media 
feed
1. The ideal social media feed is a spectrum of our FnP mood and range of products. The best practice is to distribute the 
feed evenly into product and emotional content in each grid.  
2. Give great importance to what could be the key takeaway for the audience. What’s in it for them.  
3. Ensure that we are not replicating a Pinterest board in our social media feed.
4. Experiment, innovate and redefine but keep the design language of FnP as a foundation of every social media creative. 
5. Encapsulate relatability by capturing raw and unfiltered emotion through apt imagery and communication.

68% of airline leaders polled indicated that the key to 
digital transformation was upgrading software and IT 
infrastructure. 
However, they are facing the following hindrances 
in Capitalizing Ancillaries 
Absence of Integrated Systems hampers fuel 
efﬁciency by misestimating weight & inventory. Underutilized passenger data reduces opportunities of 
cross selling, upselling and frequent ﬂier programs. Lack of real-time processing leads to increased wastage 
& undetected pilferage of inventory.

Conclusion: The Path Forward 9
Implementing Digital 
Transformation with the THRIVE 
Framework8
Digital transformation and innovation are pivotal 
for businesses aiming to thrive in today’s rapidly 
evolving digital economy. These processes extend 
beyond adopting new technologies, involving 
fundamental shifts in culture, leadership, and 
business strategies to achieve strategic goals. 
The THRIVE framework—Transformation, Holistic, 
Response, Innovation, Value, and Enterprise—
provides a comprehensive guide to navigating this 
complex journey.
Digital transformation is not a luxury – it is a 
necessity. Organisations failing to adapt risk 
obsolescence as competitors leverage data-driven 
insights, automation, and customer-centric models 
to capture market share. In the GCC, governments 
and businesses are rapidly adopting digital 
strategies to remain competitive globally.

3Digital transformation integrates advanced technologies into 
business operations to enhance efficiency, customer satisfaction, 
and competitive positioning. It goes beyond incre personalisation 
mental changes, driving comprehensive organisational 
transformation. For businesses in the GCC, this shift is particularly 
relevant given the region’s emphasis on innovation and 
modernisation.
Example: Saudi Aramco’s adoption of advanced analytics and IoT 
has optimised energy production and distribution. By integrating 
these technologies, Aramco enhanced operational efficiency, 
reduced costs, and supported Vision 2030 objectives of economic 
diversification and sustainability.
Key Features of Digital Transformation:
1. Integration of Advanced Technologies : Cloud computing, 
artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Things (IoT) 
are reshaping business operations. For example, IoT 
enables real-time monitoring and predictive maintenance 
in manufacturing, reducing downtime and improving 
productivity. AI enhances decision-making by providing 
actionable insights from complex data sets.
2. Cultural Transformation: Digital transformation requires 
a shift in organisational culture, fostering a mindset of agility 
and continuous improvement. Businesses must empower 
employees with the skills and tools to embrace change, 
encouraging innovation at all levels.
3. Customer-Centric Models: Aligning business processes 
with evolving customer demands ensures relevance 
and competitiveness. Personalisation  and omnichannel 
experiences are now standard expectations, driving 
businesses to innovate in how they engage and retain 
customers.
So why should you undergo the process of digital transformation? 
What does your business or organisation have to gain from 
something so profound as a nigh-complete cultural and operational 
change in the company when you’ve been getting by with your 
traditional methods?  Chapter 1: Understanding Digital Transformation

4Enhanced Decision-Making 
Utilise data analytics for better insights and strategies. Real-time data 
access empowers leaders to make informed decisions. In the GCC, 
organisations like Emirates NBD leverage AI to analyse customer 
data, providing tailored financial solutions and enhancing decision-
making processes.
Operational Efficiency
Streamline processes to reduce costs and improve output. 
Automation and AI optimise repetitive tasks, freeing resources 
for innovation. Manufacturing companies in the GCC, such as 
Sabic, digitalised key parts of their business to increase efficiency, 
productivity, and cost-effectiveness.
Customer Engagement
Deliver tailored, value-driven experiences. Personalisation builds 
loyalty and drives revenue growth. Businesses like Noon.com 
in the GCC have embraced personalisation  through AI-driven 
recommendations, creating a unique shopping experience that 
fosters customer retention and drives higher sales volumes.
Competitive Advantage
Adapt to market disruptions with agility. Companies that embrace 
digital strategies outperform their peers. For instance, GCC-based 
telecom operators like STC have invested in 5G infrastructure to 
stay ahead in the digital connectivity race, offering faster and more 
reliable services to meet evolving customer expectations.Practical Exercise
Exercise: Assess Your Digital Readiness
1. List three digital tools your business currently uses.
2. Identify one challenge in adopting digital transformation.
3. What is one technology you could implement easily to improve your 
business’ efficiency?
Case Studies:
• Amazon: Achieved operational excellence through AI-driven 
logistics and predictive analytics. By employing advanced 
warehouse robotics and machine learning algorithms, 
Amazon ensures efficient inventory management and rapid 
delivery. This strategy has set new standards in customer 
satisfaction and supply chain management.
• Alibaba: Leveraged data ecosystems to create a seamless 
customer experience. Alibaba’s integration of e-commerce, 
cloud computing, and logistics platforms enables a frictionless 
shopping journey. Its AI-powered chatbots and personalised 
recommendations have revolutionised online retail, 
particularly in high-demand periods like Singles’ Day.
• Netflix: Revolutionised content delivery with data-driven 
personalisation . By analysing viewing habits, Netflix tailors 
recommendations to individual users, enhancing customer 
satisfaction and retention. This data-centric approach has 
positioned Netflix as a leader in the entertainment industry, 
influencing content creation and global distribution strategies.
Organisations in the GCC can draw lessons from these global and 
regional leaders to implement strategies that align with regional 
goals and opportunities.

5The GCC region is rapidly evolving into a hub for digital 
transformation, driven by progressive regulatory frameworks and the 
adoption of cutting-edge technologies. Governments in the region 
are spearheading ambitious initiatives, such as Saudi Arabia’s Vision 
2030 and the UAE’s National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence, to 
foster innovation and accelerate technological integration. 
Regional Trends
1. Smart Cities: The integration of IoT and AI is transforming 
urban landscapes across the GCC. Cities like Dubai and NEOM 
are implementing IoT sensors and AI-powered systems to 
optimise traffic flow, manage utilities efficiently, and enhance 
public safety. These advancements are not only improving the 
quality  of life but also reducing costs and enabling smarter 
governance.
2. Sustainability: Digital tools are playing a pivotal role in 
resource optimisation and green energy projects. The UAE’s 
Masdar City, a zero-carbon urban initiative, showcases the 
potential of integrating renewable energy technologies and 
smart grids. Such projects highlight the region’s commitment 
to minimising its environmental footprint while advancing 
technological innovation.
3. Regulatory Support: Policies designed to attract 
investments in digital infrastructure are fuelling the region’s 
growth. For example, Saudi Arabia’s Communications and 
Information Technology Commission (CITC) actively supports 
the deployment of 5G networks, enhancing connectivity and 
creating a robust foundation for digital businesses.Chapter 2: Industry Trends and Innovations

6Case Studies
Dubai’s Smart City Initiative:  Dubai leads the GCC in smart 
city development, leveraging IoT and AI to improve governance 
efficiency. Programs like the Dubai Paperless Strategy aim to digitise 
all government services, cutting bureaucracy and enhancing citizen 
experiences. The city’s open data platform fosters collaboration 
among private and public entities, spurring innovation in 
transportation, healthcare, and education.
Aramco’s Digital Transformation:  As the world’s largest oil 
producer, Saudi Aramco has embraced digital transformation to 
boost operational efficiency. By deploying advanced analytics, IoT-
enabled monitoring, and AI-driven predictive maintenance, Aramco 
has optimised production processes, reduced costs, and improved 
safety standards. This transformation supports Vision 2030’s goals 
of economic diversification and sustainability, demonstrating how 
traditional industries can thrive through innovation.
NEOM’s Technological Vision:  NEOM represents the future of 
urban living and technological innovation in Saudi Arabia. This 
ambitious project plans to integrate AI, autonomous vehicles, and 
sustainable energy systems to create a global hub for advanced 
technologies. NEOM exemplifies the GCC’s vision for economic 
diversification and positions the region as a leader in pioneering urban 
innovation.
By embracing these trends and initiatives, the GCC is positioning 
itself as a global leader in the digital economy. Leveraging technology 
to address challenges and seize opportunities, the region is 
setting a benchmark for innovation-driven growth and sustainable 
development.
As digital transformation reshapes industries, continuous 
innovation becomes the driving force behind long-term success. 
Organisations must go beyond adopting technology—they must 
innovate strategically to differentiate themselves, enhance customer 
experiences, and stay ahead of market shifts.Innovation is a cornerstone for achieving market 
differentiation and fostering customer-centric solutions. By 
enabling organisations to adapt to rapidly changing demands, 
innovation creates opportunities to deliver unique value 
propositions and thrive in competitive environments. This 
chapter explores the integration of emerging technologies, 
innovative funding models, and foundational tools like the 
SMAC Stack to unlock growth potential.
Using Emerging Technologies:
Emerging technologies such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), the Internet 
of Things (IoT), and Robotics are reshaping industries by enhancing 
efficiency and driving innovation:
• Artificial Intelligence (AI) : AI empowers organisations to 
analyse complex data sets, optimise operations, and improve 
decision-making processes. For instance, predictive AI tools in 
healthcare enable early diagnosis and personalised treatment 
plans, enhancing patient outcomes.
• Internet of Things (IoT) : IoT connects devices, allowing 
real-time data sharing and smarter operational processes. 
In logistics, IoT-powered sensors ensure real-time tracking 
of shipments, reducing delays and improving supply chain 
efficiency.
• Robotics : Robotics automates repetitive tasks with precision, 
reducing labour costs and boosting productivity. Manufacturing 
facilities in the GCC are adopting robotics for assembly lines, 
ensuring consistent quality and operational scalability.

7Innovative funding models are vital for fostering growth. 
Crowdfunding platforms such as Kickstarter provide startups with 
direct access to capital from backers interested in supporting 
groundbreaking ideas. Corporate incubators, like Dubai Future 
Accelerators, nurture innovation by offering resources and 
mentorship to startups within specific industries. Public-Private 
Partnerships (PPPs) combine public and private sector resources 
to implement large-scale projects, ensuring access to funding and 
expertise for transformative initiatives.
The SMAC Stack:
The SMAC Stack—Social, Mobile, Analytics, and Cloud—serves as a 
foundation for digital transformation. Integrating these technologies 
provides:  
	•Social: Enhanced brand engagement through targeted social 
media campaigns.
	•Mobile: Seamless mobile-first experiences for customers on 
the go.
	•Analytics : Actionable insights from big data to inform 
strategies.
	•Cloud : Scalable infrastructure that supports innovation and 
collaboration.Practical Exercise
Exercise: Spot the Trend 
1. Research and list one digital innovation in your industry.
2. How has this innovation changed business models?
3. What would be the risks of not adopting this trend?
By integrating these tools and approaches, organisations can not 
only innovate effectively but also align their growth strategies with 
market demands and technological advancements. The GCC’s 
commitment to leveraging innovation through such frameworks 
underscores its ambition to lead in global digital transformation 
efforts.

As mentioned before, the THRIVE framework provides a structured 
and actionable approach to implementing digital transformation:  
1. Transformation:
•	Define clear objectives and align them with long-term business 
goals.
•	Assess readiness across technology, culture, and leadership.
•	Develop a phased approach to introduce changes 
systematically.  
2. Holistic:
• Address all aspects of the organisation, including operations, 
customer engagement, and employee enablement.
• Break down silos to ensure cross-functional collaboration.
• Create a comprehensive roadmap that integrates all business 
units.3. Response:
•	Anticipate and prepare for market disruptions and emerging 
trends.
• Use competitive intelligence to refine strategies.
• Establish agile processes to adapt quickly to change. 
4. Innovation:
•	Prioritise high-impact use cases for AI, IoT, and other 
technologies.
• Encourage a culture of experimentation and learning.
• Invest in skills development to foster innovative thinking within 
teams.  
5. Value:
•	Focus on measurable outcomes such as increased revenue, 
reduced costs, and enhanced customer satisfaction.
• Build robust business cases to demonstrate ROI and secure 
stakeholder buy-in.
• Monitor and communicate progress to sustain momentum.  
6. Enterprise:
•	Establish governance frameworks to oversee transformation 
initiatives. 
• Define roles and responsibilities to ensure accountability.
• Leverage technology to create scalable solutions across the 
enterprise.  
By following the THRIVE framework, organisations can systematically 
address the complexities of digital transformation while maximising 
value and ensuring long-term success. However, the THIVE 
framework is merely just the to-do-list at the start of your day – 
there’s a lot of work to do! Boxology can guide you in the complete 
process of digital transformation. Chapter 3: Practical Guide to Implementing Digital 
Transformation with the THRIVE Framework

9The Path Forward
Digital transformation is a critical imperative for organisations aiming to 
stay competitive and resilient. Success requires early readiness through 
proactive assessment, strategic leadership to foster innovation and align 
teams, and leveraging technologies like AI, IoT, and cloud computing to 
enhance operations and customer experiences. 
As illustrated by GCC success stories such as NEOM and Aramco, 
innovation and commitment are vital for transformative results. 
Digital transformation is an ongoing journey of evaluation, learning, 
and adaptation—take the next step by exploring training and tools 
to empower your organisation for lasting success, with Informa

Course Overview Education Partner
The internal audit report is often referred to as the “Shop Window” of internal audit. It is essential that the internal audit
reporting process delivers key messages in a professional, clear, concise and persuasive way. The purpose of the internal
audit report is to communicate findings and to gain agreement over areas where improvement is required to address the
issues identified as part of the internal audit engagement. Excellent internal audit reports support the delivery of key
findings, demonstrate the value that internal audit provides, and prompt improvements to governance, risk 
management, and control processes to help the organisation accomplish its objectives.
This course will demonstrate how effective internal audit reporting can deliver real change to organisations and enhance 
internal audit’s credibility with the board, audit committee and senior managers. 
This interactive and practical course will cover all aspects of internal audit reporting from inception to delivery and will 
examine best practice at all stages of the report writing process. The course will provide the opportunity to discuss 
challenges faced when writing impactful audit reports and how to overcome these. Established in 1996, The CPD
Certification Service is the
independent CPD accreditation
centre working across all sectors,
disciplines and further learning
applications and supports policies 
of institutional and professional
organisations globally.
CPD is the term used to describe 
the learning activities professionals 
engage in to develop and enhance 
their abilities and keep skills and 
knowledge up to date.
This course is an accredited
Continuing Professional
Development (CPD) training which
means it meets CPD standards and
benchmarks. The learning value has
been scrutinised to ensure integrity
and quality.Course Information

Gary Ingamells
I am a professional trainer, facilitator, and consultant in internal audit and enterprise risk management and a Chartered
Member of the Institute of Internal Auditors UK and Ireland (CMIIA) and the founder of CCS Training and Consultancy. I also
hold a BA in Business Studies, a Post Graduate Certiﬁcate in Education and the Certiﬁed Internal Auditor (CIA) designation
and am a PRINCE2 practitioner. 
I have over 20 years’ experience of delivering training and advice to Internal Auditors and Risk professionals from across 
the globe. This includes considerable experience of delivering training and consultancy services to organizations in the UK, 
Middle East, Caribbean, Europe and the USA on both internal audit and enterprise risk management (ERM).
Over the last 20 years I have had the opportunity to deliver training, help and advice to hundreds of internal auditors (from 
trainees to Chief Audit executives) and risk professionals from organisations in many different countries. This has given me 
real insight on how challenges and opportunities are both very similar and very different for organisations across the world. 
I have gained signiﬁcant practical experience, working with public and private sector organisations to enhance the 
effectiveness of internal audit activity, project delivery, information security, internal audit analytics, and governance and 
risk management structures. 
An experienced leader, I have lead teams of Internal Auditors in delivering value-adding assurance and consulting services 
over a wide range of challenging roles, including frontline operations, IT, Information Security and Professional Services. 
In my different leadership roles, I have represented Internal Audit at many audit committees, senior management forums 
and conferences and gained a deep understanding of what assurances stakeholders want and need. This includes the 
importance of collecting, analysing, protecting, and reporting data and data analysis effectively and efficiently. 
A high-quality Internal Audit and Advisory professional, I am an expert on the audit process and how data can be used to 
deliver real value to all organisations and at all levels. Recent practical experience has focused on information security, 
where I have provided training and advice to organisations across all sectors in the identiﬁcation, assessment, and 
mitigation of risks to effectively reduce the impact of new technologies on business performance and data security. Internal Audit Officer, Jospong Group of

Informa Connect Academy — Style guideIntroduction
Education is no longer seen as simply a precursor 
to work, or the occasional need to up-skill. Instead, 
lifelong learning is a continuous accumulation of 
knowledge throughout our careers and lives.
The brand encapsulates the dynamic nature of 
training as an ever-evolving practice that underpins 
future success for both individuals and organisations.
By intertwining fluid visual devices with a human 
approach to photography, the brand’s visual 
language expresses a sense of evolution and 
constant progression.A brighter future

Informa Connect Academy — Style guideBrand assets: Logo
LogoOur master logo is the backbone to our brand identity 
and communicates what we stand for. The master 
logo consists of a wordmark and is our unique and 
distinctive brand signal. It should never be redrawn, 
rearranged or distorted.
12
Informa Connect Academy — Style guideBrand assets: Logo
Colour forms
Our master logo is available to use in indigo and white.  
This means it is always legible on any given background.INDIGO:
WHITE:
13
Informa Connect Academy — Style guideBrand assets: Logo
Protected area
The protected area around our master logo 
ensures that no other graphic elements 
interfere with its clarity and stops designs from 
looking cramped. This is equal to ½ the height 
of the master logo.
14
Informa Connect Academy — Style guideBrand assets: Logo
Placement
Our master logo is left aligned and looks best 
when placed on the left hand side of designs. 
It can be placed in the two corners on the left 
hand side of the available space. Or it can also 
be centred within the available space.

Informa Connect Academy — Style guideBrand assets: Logo

We want to ensure that our master logo is applied 
consistently across our applications.

Endorsements
Our training brands do not need to change how they 
look but should adopt an Informa Connect Academy 
endorsement as shown over the following pages. 
The ‘Brought to you by’ or BTYB Informa Connect Academy 
logo is used to endorse our products, gain equity from the 
Informa name and to spread awareness of the diverse and 
wide-offering of Informa Connect.
The BTYB Informa Connect Academy logo is to be applied 
to all training brands printed communications, marketing 
emails & newsletters, PowerPoints, video content and 
website footers.

Informa Connect Academy — Style guideBrand strategy: Brand architecture
Brand architecture
The architecture follows the way that a user would 
expect to search for, and be informed about, a course.
The Informa Connect Academy brand identity comes 
first, followed by the course name, and then any 
endorsements or sponsorships — for example a 
University or Institutional logo. In the case of brands 
such as LMA and IFF, their logos are first and the sign-
off ‘Brought to you by Informa Connect Academy’ 
appears at the bottom of the printed material, or in the 
footer online.
For more information on applying the architecture in 
digital to refer to the Informa Connect Academy team.

it’s applied consistently it becomes a hallmark that will 
drive brand awareness. It is important that we keep 
our colour use consistent so we maintain our look and

IntroThe orbs represent a sense of growth and 
constant evolution, visually communicating 
learning as an ever-evolving practice that 
underpins future success.
Showing the orbs is not a superfluous 
ornamentation. They should always tell a story 
related to growth and help communicate the 
benefits of our products and services.

Orb placement
There are a number of different ways that the orbs can  
be placed together. Some of which are shown opposite.  
They all show a sense of growth which is essential when  
using them.
Do’s and don’ts:
• Always show the three orbs together, in the correct colour 
order. Darkest on top and the lightest on the bottom.
• There should also be clear overlap from each orb,  
no orb should be free floating.
• Only three orbs are to be used at a time.
36
Informa Connect Academy — Style guideBrand assets: The orbs
Interaction with imagery
Do’s and don’ts:
• Either use the orbs to mask an image or place the orbs 
directly into the image.
• When using the orbs to mask an image, make sure that 
you combine the image with the coloured orbs.
• When placing the orbs directly into the image, don’t 
obscure the people with the orbs.

The progression line
38
Informa Connect Academy — Style guideBrand assets: The progression line
Life-long learningThe progression line follows the continuous journey 
of lifelong learning — collecting knowledge as we pass 
through our lives and careers.
The progression line leads the eye through any 
collateral, highlighting key information. The 
progression line should always interact with  
either typography or the orbs.
39
Informa Connect Academy — Style guideBrand assets: The progression line
Typography interactions
Do’s and don’ts:
• Either align the progression line to the baseline of the text.  
Or, as shown opposite, align centrally to the text. 
• The progression lines can interact with the logo.
• Use the progression lines to highlight a key statement  
or pull quote, not a paragraph of copy.
• Only one point of connection per design. 
• Do not overcomplicate the progression lines, keep the 
amount of corners to a minimum.
40
Informa Connect Academy — Style guideBrand assets: The progression line

41
Informa Connect Academy — Style guideBrand assets: The progression line
Orb interaction
Do’s and don’ts:
• Connect the progression line to a solid edge of the Orbs,  
so either at the sides or the bottom.
42

43
Informa Connect Academy — Style guideBrand assets: The progression line
Typography and orb interactions
Do’s and don’ts:
• When using the orbs and typography in the same design, 
use one progression line.
• Don’t connect both the typography and the orbs together 
in the same design.

OverviewOur imagery aims to champion our community.  
Understanding the human impact of what we do 
means we focus on our audiences and their needs. 
Our imagery is no different. People should always  
be present whenever photography is used.
Do’s and don’ts:
• Select people that feel right for the audience we’re communicating to.
• Choose imagery that feels attainably aspirational.
• Make sure people look comfortable and relaxed.
• Showcase a range of genders and ethnicities – we believe in equality.  
Avoid stereotyping - thinking beyond the immediate ‘type’ or demographic.
• Choose imagery that feels genuine and authentic. Avoid staged situations.
• Choose imagery with warm and natural light.

Our people imagery should engage, through the warm, honest 
portrayal of individuals or groups. Opposite depicts examples of

55
Informa Connect Academy — Style guideBrand assets
120px120px 1.25px
1.25px
Construction
Icons can be effective when they are used to improve visual interest or provide functional clarity. They indicate information 
and interactions in a simple and direct manner and work well in presentations and marketing communications.
The icons are drawn on a 120px by 
120px base grid. We recommend 
making adjustments along the way to 
make sure to have the right amount of 
details that work at every size.The grid contains 10px padding. This 
ensures icons will retain their desired 
appearance when exported. Only extend 
artwork into the padding for additional 
visual weight when necessary.One icon should not look heavier 
or lighter than other icons of the 
same size. Maintain the same visual 
weight by using a 1.25px stroke when 
designing all icons.They icons can extend past the baseline grid 
and join up to form part of the Progression 
Line system. Examples of this can be found 
on the following page.

Art/Technology/Advisory/Sales & Marketing/Passion
We are targeting both Indian and diasporas Indian audience to provide them a platform for all related to Indian Contemporary Art anywhere in the world.
The focus is more on the older contemporary artworks that are or could be available for secondary sales as the new is being handled by the contemporary galleries anyways. It’s also a way for us to make these galleries become partners by offering their inventories to us for sale and then getting collectors on board to help get the confidence back on Indian Contemporary art as more and more find it difficult to trade the same in times of today. Our focus should be to make contemporary art made in the past 20-30 years more tradable and therefore create a momentum in the market and get confidence back from clients/collectors on both sides. If we can pick and pull out good works from right shows of these mid career artists and crate a platform for engagement and trade, some more people will get attracted to looking into ICA again.

Members need to make their own page by liking the below links to give them a curated section which is updated daily and all they like can be updated and sent as weekly emails to them updating about artworks, shows, news, galleries etc. Etc.
My Saves-Artists/Artworks/Galleries/Cities/Fairs
My Collection and Favourites-Can help collectors share their collection online or this could have all the desired information on all their likes from artists, artworks, cities. Individual and by Invitation users get all information on the same page for all their needs curated for them as per their likes and followings. If they share their artworks and don’t wish to sell them as well it can potentially give others in the only members group a platform to engage with the work and maybe help develop a market for these works in the future. Am thinking artworks made in the 2000’s are already 20 years old and part of the contemporary world, we should try bringing good quality works from slightly early periods for engagement. Maybe we can also be clear not to place any works here unless it’s a decade old or more. A completely different market to deal with.
Registered members get alerts weekly or daily and even an email updating their list of likes on artists, artworks, cities, shows, galleries etc.

C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\drive_export\takeout-20250828T085433Z-1-001\Takeout\Drive\KindHub\Nov New - Instructions to the bot - beauty brief.docx,"About KindHub:
Brief: https://www.kindhub.com/ KindHub is an online platform designed to simplify sustainable and ethical living by providing a clear and quantifiable method for evaluating brands and products and categorizing them into KindHub’s own value system. Here is the value system that will stay rigid and the same for all evaluations:
(KindHub's value-based system)
1. Kind to Self (Physical and mental well-being)
Category: Product Safety and Wellness
Ingredient Safety: Evaluate the safety and non-toxicity of product ingredients to ensure no harmful chemicals are used.
Effectiveness: How well the product works as intended (e.g., skincare benefits, cosmetic performance, or personal care).
Mental Wellbeing: How the product contributes to mental and emotional well-being through self-care rituals or stress-relief features, like soothing ingredients or calming effects.
2. Kind to the Earth (Resource Intensiveness and Byproducts)
Category: Environmental Impact
Sustainable Sourcing and processing: Evaluate the use of sustainably sourced ingredients and materials in the products and packaging such as organic, renewable, or recycled resources.
Packaging: Assesses the recyclability, biodegradability, and minimalism of product packaging to minimize environmental footprint and reduce waste.
Carbon Footprint and water usage: Evaluated tracking of the total carbon emissions associated with the product’s production, distribution, and usage. Measures the amount of water used in the production and lifecycle of the product, focusing on water-efficient processes, and attempts at mitigation and offset.
Waste Management: Evaluates the brand’s policies on reducing waste, including initiatives such as recycling programs or refill options for products.
3. Kind to Lives (Animal Welfare and Cruelty-Free Practices)
Category: Ethical Treatment of Animals
Cruelty-Free: Ensures that the product is not tested on animals, following cruelty-free certifications such as Leaping Bunny or PETA.
Animal-free: Measures whether the product contains any animal-derived ingredients or by-products.
Category: Ethical Impact
Fair Labor Practices: Ensures that workers involved in the production process are treated fairly, paid a living wage, and work in safe conditions.
Humanitarian Initiatives: Evaluates the brand’s involvement in charitable activities or initiatives that benefit underprivileged communities.
Community Support: Assesses how the brand supports local communities or indigenous groups, including ensuring ethical supply chain practices and giving back to the community.
Bot expectation:
We will be adding the bot on the frontend of the website to make it easier for people to make kinder choices and will help them evaluate brands and check if they align with the value system.
The end user of the Chatbot (KindHub) will only add the brand URL in the chatbot to which the evaluation can happen.
1. Beauty Brands evaluation:
All beauty brands must and only should be evaluated based on this below-given template. you must scour the internet on at least 5-10 websites or more to check and verify all information and mention the same in the notes column along with the links(MUST BE CLICKABLE) of where the information was taken from, no rows of any criteria can be empty, since the information needs to be validated and should allow users to verify the given point and understand the rationale behind the points given for all criteria. The table will display the total points given for the category(to show the attained score/out of the total assigned for the category) and the attained point for each criterion (to show attained point/total point for the criteria) by the brand that the end user puts to evaluate. Here is the final template for the beauty brand where everything has to be checked and graded as per instructions:
Notes:
Total points gained out of 100 must be displayed. Gaining 100/100 is very tough with all the criteria given. Points should not be very lenient, ALL criteria must be verified thoroughly and ONLY given. The total point of each criterion and the allotted point for the given point as a rating should be visible.
Don'ts: Do not get into anything remotely related to health and anything that requires diet or health certifications. DO NOT respond with a generic paragraph ONLY TABLE EVALUATION RESPONSE.
Conclusion to be shown:
After providing table format and scoring for a brand you must give a summary of these 4 points:
Brand’s strength
Brands’s areas of improvement
What ""value"" based on KindHub’s value-based system (given on top - Kind to Self, Kind to Earth, and Kind to Lives ONLY and no other value to be made up) does the brand fall under, and why in a brief sentence? If none of the three values apply if the points are below 30, you can say that the brand is not KindHub qualified and they should focus on being kinder one way or the other and not associate it with ANY Kindhubs value system
If the Brand is using any of the banned ingredients, ingredients to avoid, or fragrances (Unders Kind to Self values) the answer must display that the brand is using that for that in this format:
* Banned Ingredients: The brand uses prohibited ingredients
* Ingredients to avoid: The brand uses possible hormonal disruptors
* Fragrances: The products from this brand use fragrances
If the brand is not using any of the above, it can show all three points above with the finding that are on the table.
Total points gained out of 100"

When evaluating brands, here’s how to make the most informed and impactful choices:
Aim for all three values – The best brands are Kind to Self, Kind to Lives, and Kind to Earth. These are the gold standard in being kind to you and the world around you.

ABOUT US
Being kinder for the future (Mission)
Kindhub is the voice of a regular family—busy, curious, and trying to do our best. Like many of you, we juggle work, school, and life’s endless to-do lists. But as we went about our day-to-day lives, we started asking a simple question: Can the choices we make be good for us while also being kind to the world around us?
We get it—making informed, conscious decisions isn’t always easy. Between clever marketing and information overload, finding the right answers felt overwhelming. That’s when we realized it all boiled down to three things: being Kind to Self, Kind to Lives, and Kind to Earth. This framework became the foundation of how we approached every purchase, prioritizing products that checked as many of these boxes as possible.
But we quickly learned that not all products make the cut. Some are kind to you but not the planet, while others prioritize the Earth but fall short on practices that are kind to you and to others. KindHub was born from the idea that, with the right tools and guidance, anyone can make better, kinder choices. It’s not about perfection—it’s about progress.

Her intensive experience has shaped her belief in kindness, and now her mission is to make thoughtful, informed purchasing the norm—empowering individuals and families to choose kindness in all its forms.
“KindHub isn’t just about products—it’s about helping you make decisions that reflect what truly matters. Whether it’s your health, the lives of others, or the planet we share, every small choice adds up. Together, we can create a kinder world, one decision at a time.”

It’s time to take the next step. While being kind to yourself is the foundation, let’s expand that compassion to the world around us.

So, let’s practice self-care & also be kind to others and the planet, and make every choice count for a better world.
Kind to self
What does it mean?
Being kind to self means taking actions that improve your physical and mental well-being, and personal growth. It involves making informed choices which include recognizing your needs, working on your goals while practicing self-care, and treating yourself with compassion and understanding. This mindset can be the building block to expanding this compassion and understanding to the world around us - extending kindness to lives and the planet. These brands prioritize consumer well-being, fostering a sense of community and compassion, while carefully selecting high-quality, mindful ingredients.
Watchouts to remember

Clean - This is a highly overused term and the definition of clean for one brand might be different from another. So, keep an eye out for the label!
Chemical Free - This is a nonspecific term meant to mislead.
Botanical/All natural - This simply means that there are some plants in the product. It does not mean this is necessarily healthy for you.
Dermatologist Tested – This does not mean that it is dermatologist-endorsed or certified. It simply means that in a test by a dermatologist, it did not cause a reaction.
Hypoallergenic - This does not mean that allergies are not possible. It is a loosely defined term.
What are the certifications?
EWG Verified (Environmental Working Group) - Products must meet strict ingredient safety standards, avoid harmful and must also fully disclose their ingredients.
USDA Organic - Not used much in cosmetics and mostly applicable only for products that contain agricultural materials (ie) botanicals. Three levels include;
“100% Organic” - Product must contain (excluding water and salt) only organically produced ingredients. Always look for the USDA label.
“Organic” - Product must contain at least 95% organically produced ingredients (excluding water and salt). Always look for the USDA label.
“Made with Organic ingredients” - Products contain at least 70% organic ingredients. This will not have the USDA label.
What are the brands?
3 top brands that have scored highest and are assigned the Kind to Self Value
Kind to self checkpoints for you to explore
I regularly assess and adapt my self-care routines to meet my changing needs.
I recognize early signs of mental overwhelm or burnout and know when to pause.
I have effective strategies to manage stress and reduce anxiety in my daily life.
I engage in activities that boost my mental and emotional well-being.
I know specific techniques to ground myself when feeling anxious or down.
I prioritize rest and recovery as essential parts of my overall self-care plan.
Kind to lives
What does it mean?
Being kind to lives means embracing cruelty-free products and supporting brands dedicated to ethical practices. Eco-friendly brands that are kind to lives stand against animal testing, prioritize fair labor practices, and engage in humanitarian efforts to make a meaningful impact in their communities.  By choosing these brands, we help create a compassionate world for everyone.
Watchouts to remember
Plant-Based – this has become a marketing gimmick and does not guarantee that the product is vegan.
Some eco-friendly brands may be cruelty-free but their parent company is not. If this matters to you, check out the Leaping Bunny website for more information.
Common animal ingredients are Hyaluronic Acid, Collagen, Keratin, and Beeswax. You can find an exhaustive list here.
What are the certifications?
Leaping Bunny – Certifies that there is no animal testing BUT does not guarantee that the product is free of animal products.
PETA Cruelty-Free (Beauty without Bunnies) – Certifies that there is no animal testing AND that the product is free of animal products.
What are the brands?
3 top brands that have scored highest and are assigned the Kind to Self Value
Kind to self checkpoints for you to explore
I support brands that treat workers fairly and ensure safe working conditions.
I choose products from companies actively involved in community support and development.
I prioritize brands committed to ethical sourcing and production practices.
I seek out brands that donate to or partner with social causes and charitable initiatives.
I make choices that respect human rights and contribute to reducing inequality.
I prefer brands that empower and uplift marginalized communities through their business practices.
Kind to Earth
What does it mean?
At KindHub, being kind to Earth means championing sustainability through our curated selection of brands that prioritize environmental protection. This involves supporting companies that use sustainably sourced ingredients, assessing the recyclability and biodegradability of product packaging, and evaluating the brand’s policies on reducing waste, including initiatives such as recycling programs or refill options for products. We encourage eco-friendly brands to make a positive impact on the environment for future generations.
Watchouts to remember
All-natural or Natural - this does not mean sustainable. The push for natural products has led to increased deforestation
Plastic Free - this refers to packaging only and does mean that the ingredients are sourced sustainably or responsibly.
Eco-friendly - this is a nonspecific term and is used often in greenwashing. Without a certificate, this does not have any impact.
Anything in green packaging – this is a common technique to suggest that it is sustainable. Read the label.
What are the certifications?
Rainforest Alliance - Certifies agricultural products (i.e) Cocoa Butter, Shea Butter, Palm Oil, and Botanical Extracts, and looks at biodiversity conservation, ecosystem protection, worker rights, community engagement, and sustainable land management practices.
Forest Stewardship Council - Certifies wood-based products like wooden cosmetics and brushes, and looks at biodiversity conservation, indigenous rights, worker safety, and community well-being.
Ecocert Cosmos Organic - Certifies that organic and natural chemicals are grown in organic conditions free of petrochemicals while respecting biodiversity.

Sports Development Ltd . annually in India . It is recommended that the Clubs participating in the 
League ( the “Clubs ”) seeking clarification of any of these Guidelines do so by referring to this 
document.  
 
All photographs, images, designations, messages, Logos, trademarks, names, and emblems that may 
be reproduced here are for illustrative purposes only. All c opyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual 
property rights vest in and remain the legal property of the rightful owners. Through these Guidelines, 
we hope to provide the Clubs with an understanding of what is and is not permissible concerning 
sponsorshi p activities in relation to the ISL. The Clubs shall ensure that all their sponsorship activities 
comply with these Guidelines. It is also important to recognise that this document cannot provide for 
every scenario that may arise concerning the League and therefore, for this and other reasons, these 
Guidelines are subject to being updated, expanded, revised, and amended as per the League ’s 
discretion and as notified to the Clubs from time to time.  
 
These Guidelines  shall become effective upon  its publicatio n by the League and shall be applicable 
from such effective date throughout the Season and the entire Off Season, unless  superseded earlier 
by the Guidelines  published for the next edition of the ISL

1.1. The P rinciple of Centralization  
Many of the commercial rights associated with the League are centralized and shall be 
commercially exploited centrally by the League exclusively, distributed in accordance with 
ISL League Rules/Participation Agreement. This princ iple is paramount as the basis of the 
commercial model that will enable the League and all Clubs to flourish.  
 
1.2. Pre-Approval  
All Club sponsorship agreements to be signed by the Club must be agreed with the League 
and not be detrimental to it. All commercial  agreements that any Club proposes to enter into 
must be submitted for prior approval by the League.  
 
1.3. Final Decision  
In the event of any dispute concerning these Guidelines or the application thereof, the 
decision of the League is final and binding in all respects.  
 
1.4. Acceptance  
By their participation in the League, each Club will be deemed to have accepted these 
Guidelines and ensure its compliance with the same.

 Commercial Guidelines – Version 1 
 
 Player ID Guidelines  
 
16.1 Preamble  
16.1.1  Commercial Partners of the League and/or the Clubs may be granted the right to 
associate their products, services, and/or Brand with the ISL and/or Clubs in promotions 
and advertising (such persons/entities being League Commercial Partner or Club 
Sponsor respectively ). 
 
16.1.2  In such circumstances, it is permitted for the League Commercial Partner/Club Sponsor 
to use imagery of current Players of the relevant Clubs to illustrate the association 
between the Central/Club Sponsor and the relevant Club or the League.  
 
16.1.3  It is imp ortant to note that any apparent association between a Player and the League 
Commercial Partner/Club Sponsor (or their product or service)  shall  not be presented in 
a way to imply a direct relationship between that Player and the relevant League 
Commercial  Partner/Club Sponsor unless such a relationship is separately agreed to, 
independent of the League.  
 
16.1.4  Therefore, these guidelines have been developed in order to guide Clubs and Club 
Sponsors to use the permitted Player Identification to avoid implying a d irect 
relationship with a Player where no such relationship exists.  
 
16.1.5  These guidelines also serve as a good practice guide, allowing Clubs, Club Sponsors, and 
the League to work most effectively with Players and images of Players in their 
advertising and pr omotions.  
 
16.1.6  In publishing these guidelines, the organisers of the ISL are not giving any assurance or 
warranty that compliance with these guidelines will, of itself, avoid any risk of any 
implied endorsement by a Player of the products or services of any Cl ub Sponsor and 
the League accepts no liability in respect of any such implied endorsement which is 
either alleged to exist or which exists.  
 
16.1.7  In the event that any Club, Club Sponsor, or any other relevant third party has any 
doubt/query about the applicabi lity of these guidelines or whether the proposed use of 
any Player Identification is in contravention of these guidelines, they may clarify the 
same by sending an email to  ISL.SponsorServicin g@indiansuperleague.com .

Imagine a future with crisp air, towering glaciers, and a healthy blue planet. Net-Zero emissions by 2050 hold the key.
Here's the reality
We pump a whopping 36 billion tonnes of CO2 into the air yearly
️This relentless burning pushes global temperatures up
The impact? Extreme weather, rising seas, and disrupted ecosystems threaten our future
But there's hope!
The Paris Agreement aims for Net-Zero by 2050, balancing emissions with removal
Over 190 countries are on board, demonstrating a global commitment
Advancements in renewable energy offer cleaner alternatives
Are we on track?
The question remains: Are we on track?
The answer is complex. While there's progress, significant changes across industries and individual actions are crucial.
What can YOU do?
Reduce your carbon footprint - Every bit counts!
Support sustainable businesses - Look for companies committed to renewable energy and eco-friendly practices
Spread awareness -  Talk to your friends and family, and inspire them to join the movement.
Together, we can tip the scales! ⚖️

Hi,
We at Rescript are all about 'Sustainable Stationery'
What does that mean?
We do not cut trees to manufacture paper.
We use only recycled paper.
How does that help?
It takes 40,000 liters of water to manufacture 1 ton of new paper made of 
virgin pulp. Recycled paper uses 3,000 liters per ton. That's a saving of 
37 ,000 liters per ton of paper.
Is that it?
Not really. Manufacturing virgin paper causes water contamination as 
chemicals, color dyes, and bleaching agents used to achieve whiteness of 
paper enter the water table and harm our ecosystem.
Our process involves no such step.
With Rescript you can make a conscious choice to make the world a better, 
greener space.

Stationery 300 PAGES | RULED  

This unique notebook is made by  Rescript , a sustainable
stationery brand.  
How?  
We do not cut trees to manufacture paper.  
We use only recycled paper.  
What else?  
It takes 80,000 litres of water to manufacture 1 to nne of new
paper made of virgin pulp. Recycled paper uses
43,000 litres of water per tonne.  That's a saving of 37,000 litres
per ton of paper!  
Is that it?  
Not really - manufacturing virgin paper causes wate r
contamination through chemicals, color dyes, and
bleaching agents that are used to achieve whiteness  of paper,
which enters the water table and harms our ecosyste m.
This notebook is made with no such step.  
By doing this, we contribute to 4 Sustainable Devel opment Goals
(SDGs) of the United Nations.
This notebook is a step closer to making the world
greener and better.

PAPER STARTS IN THE FOREST 
At International Paper, making 
paper-based products begins with new ﬁber from responsibly managed forests or recovered ﬁber from recycling centers. 
PROCESSING 
THE FIBER
 That ﬁber is processed 
into pulp, made into paper and then transformed into everything from boxes to copy paper.
RECYCLING 
BEGINS WITH YOU
Whether at home, at the ofﬁce 
or in school, place your paper-based products in the recycling bin. PICKING UP YOUR 
USED PRODUCTS
A recycling service provider will pick 
up your used paper, corrugate d box es 
and other recyclable paper-ba sed 
products and deliver them  to a 
recycling center.SORTING IT OUT
At the recycling center, 
products are sorted, cleaned and processed. The recovered ﬁber is then transported to a paper mill to make new products.Paper's Life Cycle: 
The Recycling Process
Paper is one of the most sustainable, renewable and 
versatile products. Recycling your paper-based products 
ensures they can be used again and again.

The new definition of luxury already goes  beyond mere purchases and acquisitions —it's about 
aligning with brands that reflect  personal values and make a positive impact on the planet and 
society . 
 
Luxury brands, once synonymous with exclusivity and prestige, are facing increased  commoditi zation,  
competition and accessibility, partially due to globalization, digitalization, and changing consumer 
preferences.  This challenges traditional notions of luxury and has called for a redefinition of what 
constitutes exclusivity in a saturated market.  
 
Research from McKinsey & Company shows that 70% of all consumers now consider ‘sustainability ’ 
when making purchasing decisions, with environmental concerns ranking highest.  
 
According to a Nielsen study, 73% of millennials  are willing to spend more  on products that are 
sustainable and eco -friendly . 
 
This demographic shift is driving a n important transition from prioritizing price to embracing shared 
values, community, and social responsibility.  
 
Now, w hile several  brands are quick to showcase their environmental, social, and governance (ESG) 
credentials, consu mer awareness is also high er than ever with growing  skepticism about the sincerity 
of a brand’s efforts  and claims , which can often be perceived as  high -level  image building . 
 
The true winners? Brands  that truly embody  a long -term commitment to sustainability  with  
authenticity, transparency, community engagement,  and innovation . 
 
Yet, as sustainability becomes more mainstream, there  could be  a delicate balance to strike between 
accessibility and exclusivity. While wider accessibility is crucial for broader adoption of sustainable 
practices, some consumers value the exclusivity associated with sustainable products. This tension 
may call for  nuanced strategies from brands to maintain a sense of exclusivity while democratizing 
access to sustainable options.

No grace period for non-payment, and we don't have auto renew. The features within the application will automatically disable once the expiry date is crossed and you will have access only to reports. For now, access to reports is perpetual but might change in the future
15. How does a change in subscription work? Do we get a refund or pay extra to change users on the platform?
Once the payment is made no refund in case of a reduction in headcount. When you renew your subscription you can reduce your headcount, but you can't reduce headcount midway through your billing cycle.
You can easily increase your headcount in the subscription management module. You will be charged based on the number of months remaining in your billing cycle. For example, if you've paid for 30 employees for the period April 1st - June 30th and you add 5 employees on May 15th, you will be charged for the additional 5 employees only for the month of June but they will have access to the app from May 15th
Final list:
What payroll compliances does Ezii offer, and why are they important?
Payroll compliance involves adhering to all central and state regulations concerning employee compensation, tax withholdings, benefits, and deductions. Ensuring compliance is crucial to avoid potential legal penalties, financial losses, and reputational risks. Ezii offers end-to-end payroll processing, compliance management, and tax calculations. Additionally, we provide access to attendance and leave tracking (coming soon) as part of an integrated HRMS solution, designed to streamline and ensure accurate compliance across payroll functions.
How quickly can Ezii Payroll software be implemented?
Our payroll software is designed for quick implementation, often faster than many competitors. The onboarding process is streamlined, and our team supports client setup and migration within just 3–5 days.
What are the compliance features included in the Ezii payroll solution?
Our payroll solution includes automated tax calculations, statutory deductions, Flexible Benefits Plan (FBP) declarations, savings declarations, and reporting to ensure compliance with local laws. The system also provides alerts and updates on regulatory changes to help your business stay compliant.
Does the Ezii payroll system handle multi-state payroll?
Yes, our platform is designed to handle multi-state payroll, allowing you to process payroll and ensure compliance for employees located in different states.
Can Ezii Payroll integrate with my existing HRMS or ERP systems?
Ezii Payroll offers flexible integration options and can work seamlessly with most HRMS and ERP systems. Our team can assist in setting up integrations based on your organization’s specific requirements.
What support options are available with Ezii payroll?
We offer comprehensive support, including customer assistance during implementation and ongoing support. Our team is available for technical support, compliance updates, and user training.
What reports are available in Ezii Payroll?
Ezii Payroll offers customizable reporting options, including payroll summaries, tax reports, compliance reports, and employee earnings statements. These reports can be tailored to meet your organization’s reporting needs.
What makes Ezii Payroll unique?
Ezii offers a customizable solution that adapts to your organization’s needs, whether you choose our outsourced service or SaaS platform. Our system is designed to streamline payroll, enhance compliance, and minimize manual work, backed by 25 years of experience in the field.
Is there a grace period for payment? What happens to my data after my subscription has ended?
There is no grace period for non-payment, and we do not offer auto-renewal. The features within the application will automatically disable once the expiry date is reached, and you will only have access to reports. Currently, report access is perpetual but may change in the future.
How would changes in employee headcount affect my subscription and how would this be managed?
Once the payment is made, no refund is provided in the case of a reduction in headcount. However, during your subscription renewal, you can reduce your headcount, but not midway through your billing cycle. Increasing headcount is simple via the subscription management module, with charges based on the number of months remaining in your billing cycle.
For example, if you’ve paid for 30 employees for the period April 1st - June 30th and add 5 employees on May 15th, you will only be charged for the additional 5 employees in June, though they will have access starting May 15th."

We will require some work on our messaging that goes on to Emails as well as whatsapp forwards that should accompany the said presentations.
Aside from context below I have shared the reference presentations alongside required flow in each of the cases talked about.
Summary –
I will provide context on usage as per the division of requirements in the table above.
Intro PPT:
This would be shared both on cold emails and used as forwarded material by the customer (internally) or anyone that we are hoping to include in the company ecosystem (partners). It should give a basic idea of the company, its intentions and how we help our customers
The presentation required here would need some form of collation with what the team creates for Ezii. We have an old presentation used prior to starting the products line that talks about Resolve as a company.
Ezii PPT:
This is similar to our introduction but will be specifically for Ezii [Payroll]. We have a presentation that we currently circulate only once we have understood the requirement of a specific customer – usually sent as part of the proposal. Ideally, the same presentation with a better introduction would work, we could delete the slides on implementation or company specific details and use it when the engagement has reached a proposal stage. Essentially creating a one-fits all template that will have introduction + implementation that we can use as per the situation for a given customer.
Partnerships PPT
We have spent the least amount of time on this presentation but understand exactly what we want out of it. A sample draft was created for one of our partners thus far. We intend to use the same presentation for Tally Dealers or any other software distributors. In our outreach effort this should interest them in signing up post which we can hand over the collaterals above for them to share to end customers.
Service Order Form
We have one that we use currently. Would need this to be in line with the branding and also if we can design the features better. I would think mentioning all of that is not required. We are open to create separate proposal for pricing and SO, typically sent in 1 document though.
NOTE:
I have shared the flow for each of the requirements
Would like to go over this once to ensure no communication gaps
Would advise to start with Ezii Payroll > Intro to Resolve > Partnerships"

Brand Positioning The logo of Something's Brewing is a wordmark logo  with two 
distinctive textual styles. The first part containing ""Something's"" is 
written in a script font , and contains a graphic of a coffee bean on 
the letter S. 
The eclectic script font has been used to  evoke an 
emotional connection of creativity, youthfulness, and eccentricity to 
promote a youth-centric coffee culture.
The second part containing ""BREWING"", however, uses a  
neo-grotesque font— a refined variant of sans-serif, evoking a sense 
of openness, while also appearing a modern and progressive brand.TYPOGRAPHY

The primary logo  of Something's Brewing consists of two colours 
which are derived from the production cycle that a coffee bean goes
through, from being a berry to finally a bean , combined with the 
digital outlook of coffee.
The Cerulean colour (dark purple)  of the first part of the logo resembles
the colour of a ripe berry of the coffee plant , while the Dark Cyan/Teal 
of the second part of the logo signifies the digitally sophisticated vibe 
(or nature) of the brand.

Something’s BREWING  | Brand Guidelines
Colour is among the most recognisable and most unifying elements
in our visual identity. Colour contributes to the tone and mood of the
layout, whether it’s applied to graphics and type or paired with 
photography.
The colours of Something’s Brewing is derived from  the production
cycle that a coffee bean  goes through, from being a berry to finally
a bean combined with the digital outlook of coffee.
The primary colours of the brand are Teal and Taste of Berry.
The colour Teal should be more dominant than Taste of Berry
on any medium. Logo Usage Guide

June/July:
1. How to get over your fear of public speaking (Basics Steps)
Agenda: To give a 101 walk through to someone looking to get over the fear of public speaking
Suggested Visual: Behind the scenes pic of Nimi recording at a studio
As a TV presenter, I understand how nerve-wracking the thought of public speaking can be.
And it's completely normal to feel scared or anxious. In fact, those nerves can actually be a positive sign.
They show that you genuinely care about the outcome and want to do well. Many of us associate anxiety with negativity, but it's important to recognize that anxiety can also stem from excitement.
Think about the feeling you get when your favourite football team is about to play in the final cup or when your favourite artist is about to perform on stage.
That mix of butterflies and a slight discomfort in your stomach? That's excitement.
By learning to distinguish between anxiety and excitement, you can effectively manage your fear of public speaking.
Don't let fear hold you back!
2. How to master communication for all experience levels?
Agenda: To highlight how communication and soft skills is something that people still struggle with and what can be done to improve on them, in a motivational tone
Suggested Visual:  A picture of Nimi presenting with a big brand
From the second we are born, there is one skill, instantly demanded of us.
Communication.

It’s an essential life skill; and yet, communication is still a challenge for many people.
In a world where we are constantly “connected”, people can still struggle to communicate effectively with one another and in turn feel so… disconnected.
We naturally tend to follow the forms of communication we learned from our parents, teachers or peers; without taking into account our own individual preference or style. Because of this, we then feel frustrated for not receiving our desired results at work, in relationships or within social circles.
So, what can we do to improve on this?
1) Invest time into understanding your own communication style
2) Make an effort to listen actively to others
3) Study individuals you respect as good communicators; take notes
I found this online test to determine your Communication Style. Try it! https://virtualspeech.com/learn/communication-style-quiz
3. Throwback post conversation with Jay Shetty
Agenda: To highlight the takeaways of the conversation and what left Nimi most inspired
Suggested Visual:  Nimi’s picture of Jay Shetty
A major ‘pinch me’ moment in my life - I hosted the stage for Jay Shetty’s World Tour!
(Had to add the exclamation mark because I still can’t believe it to be honest)
…And I loved every second of it.
Jay is a dear friend of mine, and someone I respect so deeply. An individual who is giving so much light & love to this world. So when he called - of course I answered! 
A #1 New-York Times best selling author, Host of the #1 Wellness Podcast in the world ‘On Purpose’ & over 1 Billion views on social media. Jay is a force.
When Jay messaged me (casually) asking me to host the stage for his World Tour, I was shocked. Shocked not because I’m unsure of myself but shocked because someone of his position recognized my work. No matter how much you believe in yourself, when someone you highly respect acknowledges you for what you do - it’s incomparable. 

The experience was everything and more. Watching him in his element, pursuing his purpose, spreading pure love to the masses was inspiring to be a part of. I already had fire in my belly to keep pushing and working towards my goals; but seeing Jay work tirelessly to achieve this pivotal moment in his career has erupted a volcano within me!
4. How the future is for those who can master the art of listening
Agenda: To highlight how listening about others stories has helped you develop the ability to listen which is becoming a dying art and how it is something that should be the focus for the future generations
Suggested Visual: A candid conversation picture
I have always believed in the power of storytelling.
Listening to others has been an invaluable tool in developing my ability to truly communicate; however in our fast-paced world, the art of listening doesn’t seem to be of focus.

50% of being a good communicator is being a good listener.
Listening is a skill that all generations should marvel at accomplishing. When we take the time to listen to someone's story and their message, we connect with them and ourselves on a deeper level.
By listening, you actively decide to learn from someone's experience, emotion, and perspective. Moreover, it cultivates empathy, understanding, and a sense of shared humanity.
We genuinely need to create a communicative world where everyone feels heard and understood.
5. How you have grown from 2013 to 2023 with accolades
Agenda: To cover Nimi’s professional milestones and establish yourself as an industry expert on LinkedIn. And drop a subtle hint in the outro about Spkr by Nimi Mehta
Suggested Visual:  A picture of Nimi winning an award.
In 2013, fresh out of University, I embarked on an adventure which shaped the beginning of my career.
After submitting an online audition video, and a month of public voting, I finally got chosen by the judging panel to become the Face & Presenter of MTV UK. This saw me hosting red carpets, London Fashion Week, and interviewing the biggest celebrities in the world.
You can only imagine what I thought.. “I made it!” “My dreams have come true!” “This is it!”

That was far from the truth.
A year later my contract ended and I was left with nothing. The contacts I had acquired during my time couldn’t help me, there were no other roles open within the company & I was back to square one.
I spent years in the UK, trying to find my way back to the same position. Taking on unpaid work experience, internships and roles just to be in the same building where the magic happens. From MTV, ITV, Channel 4, Nickelodeon & Hello Magazine! To name a few. But to no avail.
In 2016 after a couple of years of posting YouTube videos, with only 20 views, I took a shot at radio with a local community station.
In 2017, I took a leap of faith & applied for a radio role in the UAE, moving away from the UK. I went from hosting a local radio station of 1000 people to a National Breakfast Show broadcasting to a whole country.
Since then, my life has changed.
Last December, I made a bold decision to resign from my radio position and start my own project.
I knew I needed to use the skills I’ve acquired to help others. I launched #SPKRbyNimiMehta - a Public Speaking Masterclass to help individuals discover the power of their voice.
All this to say, throughout the past decade, each step has challenged me and pushed me to achieve excellence. But I never stopped believing in the vision I had for myself. Never get too comfortable with where you are, consistently look to improve your skills & when you’re able, use your gift to help others.
6. Learnings for GenZ to not rush for success
Agenda: To show why GenZ is on the fomo train because of social media and they should be patient and go for instant gratification
Suggested Visual:  A picture of Nimi on the phone scrolling Instagram/Tiktok OR at one of her Podcasts
The world has changed at a drastic pace. Only the other day I was reminiscing with my Mum and sister on my childhood. How my generation, ‘The Millennials” weren’t born into the digital world but grew up witnessing the transformation into the new age. I know I’m not the only one who remembers timing my access to the internet around my Mum’s home phone schedule, jumping onto the PC as soon as her phone call ended, followed by the iconic dial up internet tone and signing into MSN Chat (the OG social media platform!). 

It’s made me look back at my experience as a teenager & compare it to what the now teenagers are experiencing. After visiting many schools around the UAE, the one question I love to ask the kids is: “What do you want to be when you’re older?”
The #1 answer is: “I want to be Tik Tok/Instagram famous”
It is clear, we live in a world where the younger generation is seeking instant success.
Furthermore, the allure of social media has created a fear of missing out (FOMO) for Gen-Zers. But there are many downsides of seeking quick fame.
It may seem appealing right now, but can it be sustained? Can it be internally gratifying? What are the dangers associated with their mental health?
Building a solid foundation for success takes time and effort.
According to the World Economic Forum, Gen-Z will make up 27% of the global workforce by 2025. However the sad reality is, Gen-Z is falling behind in skills needed to enter the workforce; Technological skills, Communications skills, Financial Literacy to name a few.
Here’s how they can counter this:
1) Enrol in extra curricular activities that improve their essential life skills
2) Gain work experience within different industries, to see what they gravitate towards
3) Network and engage with as many people in your area of passion as possible
Overnight success may seem like a win but it’s rare and often short-lived if real-life skills, strategy and planning are not executed.
7. How you overcame Shyness and Built Confidence
Agenda: To cover the aspect of how you were shy and now doing the complete opposite of that and a subtle play on starting to write on LinkedIn
Suggested Visual: Nimi speaking on stage or at an event, we can use GaryVee’s pic or any other famous person’s pic
I get asked all the time “How are you so confident?”
But the truth is, as a teenager, I was extremely timid and a pure introvert.
It was clear I lacked confidence, so my parents tried everything to get me out of my shell. Nothing worked. But I finally found solace and success in sports, particularly tennis. I represented Great Britain at a semi-professional level, travelling the world playing (and sometimes winning) in International tournaments. Despite this achievement, social interactions remained super challenging for me.
Once I decided to leave full-time sport and pursue my education, I got into Broadcast Journalism and tried my hand at every single opportunity. If you see my work experience portfolio, you’ll see I tried every role possible within TV & Production to have a more wholesome understanding of the industry. Interacting with strangers, (something I absolutely dreaded), started to become my norm. Putting myself in situations I felt uncomfortable in, demanded my communication skills to improve or I’d get left behind.
So, at this point
Did I feel confident? No.
Would I actively speak up? No.
Was I able to communicate to the best of my ability? No.
And now with experience as a National Radio Host, a National TV Host broadcasting to hundreds of thousands of people & being an International MC; I am living proof that it’s possible. It’s possible to not only overcome your fear, but to become an expert in that very field, through sheer focus, preparation and practise.

So how did I do it? How did I transform into a strong communicator?
I genuinely believe I faked it, till I became it.
I took on a persona which eventually became me.
It was always there within me, I just hadn’t tapped into it.
8. How do you start your day? ( A sneak peak into Nimmi’s daily routine )
Agenda:  To give a sneak peek to your audience to build an authentic connection
Suggested Visual:  A picture of Nimi having coffee, reading a book or meditating
It’s been a while since I started writing on LinkedIn, so thought to give you all a sneak peek into my daily routine.
I get so excited to time-block my day. It’s by far my most favourite thing to do…
I kickstart with a 10-minute guided meditation.
It clears my mind and helps me focus.
I write in my gratitude journal, in list format, of all the things and people I’m grateful for.
This sets a positive tone for the day ahead.
As you can imagine none of my days are the same. Which I love.
I block the first hour or two of my day for exercise. As an ex-athlete, physicality is very important to me and for my mental health wellbeing too. 

I time block for:
Planning the week ahead
Replying to emails
Meetings
Coffee breaks
Calls with my Mum
Creating proposals
Lunch
Taking my dog for a walk
Meeting friends
Just to name a few…

With so many things for us to do in the day, personally & professionally, time blocking helps you to improve your focus. It also keeps you from being distracted and context switching (which is something I always struggled with!)
Feel free to share productivity methods that work for you! Would love to know…
9. Why does the world need a new Educational System?
Agenda: To point out Nimi’s POV about what is wrong with the older education system and how it will get fixed
Suggested Visual:  A picture of Nimi with children or at a college or university or an event where she’s  speaking

I’ve been giving a lot of thought to how my educational experiences have shaped me into who I am today. It’s clear to me that the education system I came through in the UK didn’t support me in the best way possible. It didn’t cater to my needs, my creativity or my strengths. I felt constantly pressured to fit into a box I had no interest in being in.
If I was to go through the education system again, I would hope the world sees we need a more up-to-date approach. One that equips students with real-life skills and not just text books.
From communication skills to financial literacy to the importance of wellbeing, there are so many areas that need attention and understanding during these development years.
It's fascinating how we were so focused on academics and achieving good grades. I mean, I came out of University into the adult world being able to recite the periodic table, but had no idea what taxes were!
Although I’ve heard that children nowadays are getting a more bespoke experience in school than we once did. I am hoping with the pace at which society is moving, the educational systems around the world adapt much quicker to the new world. Especially for us creatives!
Would love to know your opinion on this! What do you think?
10. How you turned it around in 2014 to your current state
Agenda: To highlight Nimi’s journey from being unemployed to now
Suggested Visual: Any candid picture from one of Nimi’s Radio Studios will be great
Over the years, I have realised that each hurdle has only made me more determined to succeed.
In 2014, after achieving the job of my dreams, my world crashed when my contract with MTV ended and I found myself with no job or a plan. I struggled with unemployment and felt depressed., questioning everything.

Eventually, I made the difficult decision to take a PR job, burying my dreams of becoming a TV Presenter. It was a battle between my heart and my head. Ultimately, after 2 years I chose to follow my heart. I risked quitting my steady PR job to refocus my energy on creating YouTube videos and pursuing opportunities in Radio.
Finally, moving across the world on my own, at 25 years old for my dream job, changed it all.
Today, when I look back at my journey - from unemployment to National Radio & TV  - I only have gratitude.
Remember, obstacles are opportunities in disguise.
11. Public Speaking Statistics (Men Vs Women) to Inspire women (Link)
Agenda: To cover the topic of how low the numbers are when it comes to women in public speaking. Also cover Nimi’s input of “you don’t have to be loud to be heard”

Suggested Visual:  A picture of Nimi public speaking, if there is one with a lot of women then it would be great
When I first started to explore the world of Public Speaking as an art; I didn’t realise there was such a large gender disparity; from the emotions involved, to how it’s approached,  to the overall human experience.

Did you know that women are significantly underrepresented when it comes to public speaking?
According to Bloomberg, male speakers still outnumber female speakers by a 2 to 1 ratio at business conferences.
In a 2020 study, involving 500 undergraduate students, a field experiment was run to analyse whether in an incentivized setting men and women show differences in their willingness to speak in public. They found that while women are more willing to present face-to-face, they are considerably less likely to give a public presentation.
It's sad to see how few women are taking the stage and using their voices.
Women have valuable stories, experience and insight; we just need to discover the power of our voice for it all to be heard. 

Reminder: You don't have to be loud to be heard.
Your words have power, regardless of volume. Words tied in with actions have an even larger impact.
Instead of getting discouraged by these statistics, I use this as fuel to empower and encourage more women to invest and build on their greatest asset; their voice.
12.  Personal Productivity Hack around how to be productive
Agenda: To highlight that you choose your productivity not the cliched work hours
Suggested Visual: Nimi working on her laptop or delegating her team
My productivity hack?
It is definitely not found in the cliched 9-5 clock time!
I believe that the idea of a set time for work is outdated. I am my most productive self at night time.
What matters most is getting the job done and achieving your goals, regardless of the time of day.
But, productivity isn't just about individual effort. It's also about team morale, toxic culture and job satisfaction.
And as a leader, you should be conscious of that. If team morale is low, it can seriously impact productivity.
So, think outside the box and challenge traditional notions of work hours and productivity.
August:
1. What food/drink to avoid when Public Speaking
Just like footballers watch what they eat before a big game, speakers should watch what they eat before speaking publicly.
There are certain foods that can have a negative effect on your voice, such as increased production of phlegm.
I have put together a list of the usual suspects for mucus-producing foods; although not all of them may have the same effect on you:
Dairy
Caffeine
Hot spices
Soft drinks
Refined sugars
Chocolate
Iced drinks
Alcohol
There can be food sensitivities as well. However, these can be subjective.
Some of the foods that people can be sensitive to include:
Wheat
Nuts
Shellfish
Soy
Spicy foods
Berries
A general tip: avoid any heavy meals before the talk but also don’t starve yourself.

2. Taylor Swift & Ownership
My social media these days is all about Taylor Swift and her Eras World Tour.
And although I’m not a self-declared ‘Swiftie’, I deeply respect her as an Artist.
All the albums Taylor composed, recorded, and released were snatched by others and resold, denying her the chance to buy her own music.
Consequently, she re-recorded these albums as 'Taylor's version,' which now dominates the charts and are record-breaking.
This made me think about the significance of ownership in one's life and profession.
While we toil for corporations and roles with limited sway, we maintain complete authority over our own narrative.
Our essence transcends jobs; a job isn't our essence.
So start investing your uncommitted hours in self-growth and building your identity.
3. The importance of internships/work experience
If it weren’t for unpaid internships and voluntary work, I wouldn’t be where I am today.
As a teen, experience in the media was all I craved, the stipend was secondary.
I explored various avenues - shadowing an editor at the local newspaper, interning in ITV's Production team, and a week at HELLO! Magazine.
These trials guided me toward the TV.
Here’s a picture of me when I interned at a UK production house.
We flew to Borneo’s Amazon Rainforest for 6 weeks to film a documentary in the - unpaid but invaluable experience.
For those grappling with their path, practical engagement trumps mere job searches on Google and online tests.
Dive in, embrace the mess, and cultivate connections.
This journey reveals your essence.

4. Nando’s SPKR Workshop
Whenever any company or brand approaches SPKR Nimi Mehta for 'Character Confidence Communication' Workshops for employees.
My initial query is, ""What takeaway do you desire for your team?""
For instance,
For Nando’s UAE Team, the goal was to boost Restaurant Managers’ confidence in effective communication, given their non-English background.
I conducted 2 workshops, each hosting 20 members.
These workshops were tailored to the specific needs of the restaurant industry, emphasising the communication skills required in the service industry.
Every SPKR by Nimi Mehta workshop is designed specifically by recognizing unique industry demands, departmental dynamics, and individual communication styles.
To enquire about a workshop, feel free to reach out & we can discuss it!

5. Why mentors are important
As my career advances, I am realising the importance of seeking guidance without shame.
The term 'mentorship' has a formal feel to it.
I used to believe mentors involved contracts, official agreements, and clear dynamics.
Now I see mentorship as a friendship, built on mutual respect, admiration, and patience.
Looking back, I lacked a true guiding figure, often feeling alone.
Yet, over the last few years, my network has become my mentor, even beyond my field.
It's not about formalities, but genuine care, evident in late-night WhatsApp messages during doubts.
We are all mentors to each other, even though we haven’t met - one post at a time - inspiring and celebrating each other!
6. Host of Mastercard @ Michelin Guide Dubai 2023
It was an instant yes when I was approached to host The Michelin Guide Dubai Ceremony 2023 by Mastercard.
I loved working with such a creative and wonderful team.
Being a TV Host and MC - it’s my job to shapeshift into a representative of the brand I’m booked by.
From the minute I am confirmed for the job to being on stage - I am fully hands-on.
At that moment I just learned to live and breathe the brand.
That’s why I love my job - no job or gig is the same.
I am fortunate to work with world-renowned brands like Mastercard which ooze absolute professionalism.
Check out our coverage on The Michelin Guide Dubai 2024!

7. How sports has disciplined my everyday life
A lesser-known fact about me - I was a Semi-Professional Tennis Player for GBR from ages 14 to 18.
If you’re like me and have watched ALL the sports documentaries on Netflix, you’ll understand the discipline, drive, and focus it takes to be a professional athlete.
Tennis consumed my existence back then.
Reflecting on that era with mixed sentiments, I cherish the experience.
Today, I channel the same athletic discipline into my media career.
Early morning training routines are now transformed into hosting a UAE National Radio Show from 6 am after rising at 4 am.
Meticulous scheduling drives my productivity, mirroring my past training regimen.
Just as I dissected training footage for improvements, I now analyse TV shows, podcasts, and MC videos.
Even though I'm no longer a high-performance athlete, I'm forever grateful for the discipline & structure instilled in me at a young age.
8. How I got into radio
Nothing is an ‘overnight’ success.
It takes years of hard work, patience, and focus.
But my radio career is an anomaly.
“How did I get into radio?”, one may ask.
Well, the truth is, radio was never the plan.
I knew I had to redirect when TV opportunities in the UK were not coming through.
I discovered Vibe FM, my local station in Watford, with a small audience.
Despite no pay, I secured the prime 5-7 pm slot after a few months.
Later, I applied for a radio role in the UAE.
In under 8 months, I progressed from a local show to becoming the Breakfast Host on Radio 1 UAE in Abu Dhabi.
Success requires time and preparation, but seizing the right opportunities can lead to unexpected growth.

9. Is it copying or is it inspiration?
Author Austin Kleon's “Steal Like An Artist,” says that if you copy from one person, it’s plagiarism.
But if you copy from many people, it’s original.
As a TV Host, Radio Presenter, MC, and Speaker, I proudly admit to being shaped by numerous remarkable figures like Oprah, Jameela Jamil, and Maya Jama. (The list is too long, honestly)
I am not emulating them, but their influence forms the bedrock of my unique style.
I amalgamate their excellence with my distinct touch to evolve into the finest version of myself.
Originality doesn't demand absolute novelty.
I mean, if that were the case, most of the beauty brands would run out of business.
Nonetheless, I would love to know your thoughts on the same.
10. Creating your Alter Ego
Beyonce has Sasha Fierce.
Kobe had The Black Mamba.
Eminem has Slim Shady.
Alter egos aren't exclusive to the super-successful.
Why not cultivate one for ourselves?
Although my alter ego lacks a name (suggestions appreciated), the version of me gracing screens, airwaves, or stages, is a persona I have honed.
I advocate this technique in my workshops.
Envision your boldest, most commanding self - visualise, audibly sense, and feel it.
Jot down your responses and refine them over time.
There you have it - your alter ego is born.
Unveil it confidently in boardrooms, conferences, or amidst loved ones.

11. Relationships at Work
Early in my career, I vowed to embody the qualities of an ideal colleague - diligent, inspiring, resilient, optimistic and humour-filled.
So, why not be that person for others?
In my roles in mainstream media - TV, radio, and MC gigs - I interact daily with a diverse array of professionals.
From producers and directors to co-hosts, makeup artists, and crew members, I prioritise ensuring their work experience is positive.
Although I am human and have tough days, I strive to maintain a proactive attitude almost 95% of the time.
This not only nurtures a better work environment but also cultivates personal contentment and positivity.
Also, I think energy speaks above everything.
Acknowledge the paramount significance of energy in our workplace, where we predominantly invest our time.

12. Digital Communication: 5 Tips for Virtual Meetings
In today's world, remote meetings and presentations are a global thing.
In a recent workshop, I was asked for tips to engage a virtual audience effectively.
Well, here are my top 5:
 
1. Set the agenda:
Prioritise clear communication by informing attendees of the meeting's purpose beforehand.
Organise the agenda, time frame, and task delegation to maintain engagement and productivity among team members.
2. Prepare beforehand:
Online meetings require greater preparation.
Visuals enhance engagement by up to 94%!
Leading to improved attention, memory, inclusiveness, and interaction.
Especially for younger teams; 64% of Millennials grasp visual communication swiftly.
3. Sometimes small talk does wonders:
Yes, it’s awkward.
But engaging with peers, colleagues, and the team is vital.
Despite the discomfort, active participation draws attention in the 'virtual room', fostering inclusivity and recognition from the start.

4. Keep it short and concise:
Ideal virtual meeting duration?
Research shows 83% lose focus after 45 mins.
Opt for concise, effective meetings to engage attendees.
5. Ask questions:
Avoid monotony.
Segment your presentation for pauses and interaction.
Maintain engagement and keep the audience attentive and active.
What would you add to the list?
13. What is your niche?
Growing up as a teenager during YouTube's rise, I felt far from unique.
From watching Lilly Singh amuse thousands from her bedroom to Zoella building a multi-million empire with hauls and vlogs - it all made me see them as uniquely successful.
In response, I tried to carve my own path, but I lost myself in the process.
I launched my YouTube channel and I experimented with vlogs, politics, skits, and makeup trends, but nothing felt natural.
Until a friend's question about my niche left me lost for words.
Now at 32, I have grown a lot more confident.
And I advise everyone, regardless of age, to forget about being distinctive.
Your essence, voice, and energy are unparalleled - you are your own niche.
September:
Post 1: Podcast Hosting
Over the years, I have interviewed individuals from all walks of life;
Global CEOs, digital thought-leaders, social change-makers, etc.
Though every interview is different, I try to get the best out of my guests during my podcasts.

Here’s what my prep looks like:
Requesting profile brief from the guest: This gives you a great indication of what the guest would want you to emphasise on.
Doing research: Research the guest's personal and professional history, previous interviews, and their current industry trends.
Composing ‘Go-To’ questions: These will be the skeleton of your interview to add the narrative on your guest.
Listening during the interview: The answers from your guests will lead you to add to the body of the conversation & lead you down organic paths.
Keeping the audience in mind: Create a question structure that considers the audience's interests and desired takeaways.
This is what works for me. For those that have any more, please share!
Post 2: How including 10 minutes of meditation helped you in your professional development?

In the whirlwind of professional responsibilities, it is easy to overlook the incredible impact of small habits.
I used to be a sceptic, but dedicating just 10 minutes a day to meditation has been a game-changer in my career journey.
Meditation isn't about escaping reality; it is about embracing it with clarity and calmness.
Those brief moments of mindfulness have boosted my focus, creativity, and resilience.
It is like a gym for the mind that keeps me in top shape for every public speaking engagement and master my role efficiently.
Post 3: Never settle for less
A major brand recently approached me to be a Host for a prominent event.
When I was approached, I was genuinely over the moon that my reputation and quality of work within the industry had been recognized. But VERY quickly, my excitement turned to disappointment when they offered no payment, proposing a ""barter deal” of seemingly no value to me.
I was shocked but also briefly tempted by the offer, recalling my early days of working for free to gain experience wherever I could. Then, I instantly reminded myself of my decade of dedication to mastering my craft. That changed everything.
I kindly declined the offer.

All this to say, I am so proud of myself for valuing my worth. The lesson here is that while we can't make others see our value, maintaining self-respect attracts others who are willing to reciprocate with what you deserve.
Post 4: Why mental health as a subject should be given importance in our education system.
Growing up during my school years, there was never a focus on mental health. Although things have changed in recent years, it’s still not enough.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), approximately 10-20% of children and adolescents worldwide experience mental health issues.
The most common mental health issues among students include anxiety disorders, depression, ADHD, and eating disorders.
Moreover, many students face barriers when seeking help.
Wondering why?
Stigma surrounding mental health often prevents students from openly discussing their struggles or seeking support.
Lack of awareness about available resources and limited access to mental health services in schools are also significant barriers.
So I’ve been thinking about what role our education system should play…
- Promote awareness, destigmatize mental health, and provide appropriate resources.
- Incorporate mental health education into the curriculum.
- Enable collaboration between schools, parents, and mental health professionals.
With this, students can develop resilience, coping skills, and a better understanding of their own mental well-being.
We all should advocate for a curriculum that nurtures not just the minds but also the hearts!
Post 5: Affective Presence
I recently stumbled upon the intriguing concept of ""affective presence"".
And I have been delving into it ever since!
What is it? Well it’s basically your emotional fingerprint. Psychology tells us that how we affect others is a measurable part of who we are.
On a personal level, those who consistently uplift others tend to be the heart of their social circles and attract more romantic interest due to the positive vibes they radiate.
On a professional level, having a positive affective presence can foster open communication, a safe space for ideas, and a more inclusive workplace culture, ultimately boosting performance.
So, as you are at your work, consider the impact of your emotional power!
Post 6: How will AI benefit or hinder your work?
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is undoubtedly transforming the way we do business;
Our media and entertainment industry is no exception. I’ve had conversations amongst peers where some fear it might replace the human touch,  however I really see it as a powerful tool to enhance how I go about my profession.
According to a report published by the World Economic Forum, 40-50% of all tasks at work will be automated by the year 2025.
While this might be a cause for concern, it also presents an opportunity for us to adapt and evolve.
Here’s why I see it as a powerful tool to enhance what I do:
Personalization: AI can help tailor my speeches and event experiences to the audience's preferences, making every engagement more impactful.
Efficiency: Streamlining event logistics and communication, allowing me to focus on what truly matters - connecting with the audience.
However, I do completely agree that there still lies challenges in ethics and security.
There are steps to be taken to ensure AI doesn't compromise the authenticity of human interaction. I guess it’s a case of becoming one with AI in communication instead of treating it as an external entity.

Post 8: Advice or tip to anyone who wants to start their career as a TV presenter.
Agenda: Highlight your position as an industry expert by guiding beginners in your domain.
I often get asked for advice on how to kickstart a career as a Presenter. So, here's my tip for anyone who wants to dive into this shiney world of TV presenting…Be a sponge!
Absorb as much knowledge and experience as you can from those experienced in the field.
I’ve interned at local TV stations, assisted seasoned presenters, and attended industry events; and believe it or not - I did it ALL for free, for years! And I wouldn’t change it for the world.
I would suggest the same to anyone who wants to get stuck in and learn from the ground up.
Next, immerse yourself in the world of Media. This will not only give you invaluable exposure but also help you build a strong network. Use social media to connect with those you want to be working alongside & reach out to them for advice.
Additionally, hone your skills by practising in front of a camera. Start a YouTube channel, create engaging content, and gather feedback to improve your skills. Remember, practice makes perfect!
Lastly, stay up-to-date with what’s going on in the world & be ready to speak about it at any given moment. Being well-informed will make you a versatile presenter who can connect with diverse audiences.

Anything is possible - you just have to make it happen.
Post 9: Study your favourite Speakers
For me, it all began with a simple yet profound realisation: to find your own voice, study the voices that have already made their mark.
Whether you dream of being the world's best athlete, an astronaut, or a top-notch barista, learning from those who have walked the path you aspire to walk, is a game-changer.
In my journey towards mastering Public Speaking and Communication, I drew inspiration from some incredible individuals; Oprah, Iyanla Vanzant, Jameela Jamil, Jay Shetty, and Chris Gardner - to name a few.
As I listened to their speeches, interviews, and talks, I took notes on their presence, body language, voice modulation, and audience engagement. Then, I incorporated what felt natural into my own style.It simple: inspiration can be found everywhere; you just have to seek it intentionally.

Post 10: How organisations/ companies can foster a positive body Image culture?
Agenda: Discuss the importance of promoting body positivity within the workplace and the positive impact it can have on employees well-being and productivity.
Suggested visual: On-stage picture where you are addressing the audience.
Have you ever wondered if there is more to communication than just words?
Well, there is - your body movements.
Did you know that only 7% of communication is based on words alone?
The remaining 93% is conveyed through non-verbal cues such as body language, facial expressions, and gestures.
Your body movements can speak volumes about your thoughts and feelings.
For example, crossed arms might indicate defensiveness or disagreement, while open and relaxed gestures convey approachability.
Even the way we make eye contact can make or break a conversation.
Understanding body language can have a significant impact on your personal and professional relationships.
By becoming more aware of the signals you are sending and receiving, you can enhance your communication skills and build stronger connections.
Post 11: Interview
I had the honour of being the first-ever guest on ""The Pulp Podcast"" hosted by the amazing
@Yasmine Mustafa.
We had an engaging chat about my journey, including the ups and downs of my confidence, my transition to Radio, and the daring leap into TV.
Communication is one of the most paramount skills in life, yet somehow a lot of us still struggle with it. So I shared some useful tips & techniques to help those in need of some inspo!
Big thanks to Yasmine for this fantastic opportunity and for kicking off this awesome project!

Post 12: Focus on yourself and not on what others think about you. Make yourself a priority and not others.
Agenda: Share your personal experience of how you were worried what others think of you and when you stopped doing that, it all worked out for you.
Did you know that studies show that people who focus on themselves and their own growth are more successful and fulfilled?
For years, I was consumed by what people thought of me. It felt like I was living to meet their expectations and not my own.
It  was so easy to get caught up in seeking validation from others.
At some point a shift happened. Recently, I feel I conduct myself differently. I learned that I was focused on the wrong thing.
I realised, by shifting our attention away from what others think about us, we free ourselves from unnecessary stress and self-doubt, and there is SO much power in it.
According to a survey conducted by Forbes, 70% of successful individuals credit their achievements to maintaining a strong sense of self and staying true to their own values.
So, stop worrying about pleasing everyone and start investing in yourself.
All this to say…Remember, people's opinions are subjective and ever-changing;
Don't let them define your worth.

Post 1: Art of Persuasion
A powerful presentation requires persuasion.
So, how can you achieve that?
Know your audience: Begin by understanding your audience's needs, motivations, and values. Tailor your message to resonate with their perspective.
Craft engaging stories: Storytelling is a persuasive powerhouse. Incorporate personal anecdotes and success stories to stir emotions and highlight your ideas' value.
Establish credibility: Authenticity and transparency go a long way in winning over your audience.
Choose persuasive language: Use confident, powerful language that emphasizes the benefits of your proposals. Employ rhetorical devices like repetition and impactful metaphors.
Listen actively and show empathy: Understand your audience's concerns and objections. Acknowledge their viewpoints, and address their needs to demonstrate your appreciation for their input.
Feel free to add to the list in the comments section!
Post 2: Reactions and appreciation towards the course.
The response to my Public Speaking Mentoring has been overwhelming.
My inbox contains recurring messages from caring parents wanting their children to enrol in SPKR by Nimi Mehta.
They say things like, ""I want my daughter to discover her voice!"" and ""My son is super  shy, I want him to realise his power!""
These parents are on the right track because I’ve specifically designed SPKR to empower people of all ages.
There are valuable points parents can actually implement at home, to give their kids a head start:
How you talk to your children shapes their inner voice. Speak to them with respect and grace, like they are fellow adults.
Foster resilience by creating a safe space for them to share their challenges and lows.
Boost their emotional intelligence by helping them express their feelings with words.
To make sure the next generation are happy and confident, we need to understand that we’re the force behind them. Helping them create a powerful reality of themselves for now and for the future.
Post 3: Gary Vee
During my interviews, it is always fascinating to uncover the hidden human side of the thought leaders I come across.
I had one such amazing chat with @ Gary Vee recently.
One of my favourite moments was when Gary shared his journey of finding, shaping, and safeguarding his voice.
While speaking with him, I realised that behind every success story, there's a unique path of self-discovery.
You need to be true to yourself and dig deep enough to find it first, then to express it.
Just keep exploring your voice and, like Gary, don't be afraid to protect it!

Post 4: Unscripted @ Paus Cafe
It was such an honour to be the first guest of the ‘Unscripted’ Series at Paus Cafe & Community in Dubai. An intimate setting with people who took time on their Sunday to be with myself and the Founder, Sophiya - to have a good old-fashioned face to face conversation about my journey, career and challenges.

Although I was there to instil wisdom and share my experiences - what I walked away with was the deep understanding that we all share the same inhibitions, the same doubts and the same insecurities. No matter who we are, where we’re from or what we do. 

In understanding that, I have an even deeper love for all those that I know and don’t know. A deeper level of empathy. Because that’s what it’s always been about - the human to human connections we make during our time on this earth. Everything else is noise.
Post 5: Importance of taking risks in life.
Agenda: Share your dilemmas and also the belief you had when you quit the job of 5 years to start something of your own - #SPKRbyNimiMehta.
Suggested visual: Image of you from your masterclass.

When I left my job of 5 years, hosting a National Radio Breakfast Show - I was terrified.
Terrified that it could be the biggest mistake of my career. It was a huge risk, I didn’t have another job lined up, no guaranteed income, because all I wanted to do was start my own business.

SPKR by Nimi Mehta was born a few months ago. A Public Speaking Online Masterclass, which offers in-person Group workshops, 1 to 1’s and Company Sessions.
Alongside my TV Show, MC gigs & SPKR Workshops - I ‘ve kept busy & thriving.
I look back now, so proud of myself that I took the leap. It could’ve gone either way (terribly wrong!) but I’m so glad I followed my gut and believed in myself. 

This is your sign to take that bet on yourself. It seems uncomfortable, it feels too risky, there’s a chance of failing - but at least you know you tried.
Post  6: MENTAL HEALTH IN THE WORKPLACE
In a world where we spend a significant portion of our lives at work, the importance of happiness cannot be overstated. A good boss plays a pivotal role in creating an environment where happiness thrives, ultimately benefiting not just employees but the entire organisation.
I wish I could say I’ve had role-model bosses but that just hasn’t been the case. However the silver-lining is, I learnt everything I didn’t want to be, as a boss.
- Leadership Sets the Tone. A good boss is the guiding light, setting the tone for the entire team. Their positivity, empathy, and support create a culture of happiness, where employees feel valued and motivated.
- Empowerment and Trust: A supportive boss empowers employees and trusts them to make decisions. This autonomy not only boosts morale but also makes employees feel more invested in their work, leading to increased happiness.
-Recognition and Appreciation: A good boss recognizes and appreciates the efforts of their team. Acknowledging achievements, no matter how small, boosts confidence and fosters a sense of fulfilment.
-Open Communication: Effective communication is key to happiness at work. A great boss encourages open dialogue, where employees can express their ideas, concerns, and feedback without fear of judgement.
On the other hand, if you've been lucky enough to have a boss that holds all these qualities or at least one of them. I would let them know how much you appreciate them. It goes both ways!
Post 7 : Why to build a personal brand as a TV presenter or radio show host?
Agenda: Explain the importance of personal branding for presenters in the media industry, and how your journey has shaped your personal brand as a relatable and engaging host.
Suggested visual: Your candid picture.
Building your own brand, based around you - is not as simple as some may think. 
I’m currently in a transitional period of my career - I’m doubling up as an Entertainment Host and Public Speaking Mentor. Two pretty opposing notions.

I struggled with the thought that both roles required two very different audiences.

“But will they take my advice seriously? I’m the girl who talks about Celebs on the TV & Radio”
“Will they question my credibility as a Mentor because I have a podcast where I talk about trivial things?”
But a close friend of mine said something profound.
“Nimi, you can be two things at once.”
We get stuck in the mindset that we need to be ONE thing. We pigeon-hole ourselves because society has moulded us to believe that’s where we should be and stay.
But I no longer want to conform.
So… My name is Nimi Mehta. I'm a TV & Radio Host, MC, Speaker & Public Speaking Mentor. I do it all and I LOVE it!
Post 8: One trend in the media or entertainment industry you want to end and why.
Agenda: Your point of view on any trend you think is not adding value in your industry but still people follow it.
Suggested visual: Your picture in a professional setup.
If you were told you can equally achieve your end goal by either being kind or by being mean - which would you choose?
There’s a myth around the Media & Entertainment  Industry being a “dog eat dog” world. For the majority of my career I’d say I was completely oblivious to it - but as time goes on it’s becoming more prominent.
The lack of support to one another, the comparisons, the jealousy.
I’ve never operated from that place. I’ve always believed every single one of us is in their own lane, that we all bring something completely unique to the table.
I consciously make a point to verbally support my peers or go up to others in a media room and say hello, or even go out of my way to DM others in the field I think are doing a great job.
Why? Because I would appreciate it so much if I was treated the same. With kindness & respect.

I refuse to become part of what the industry is used to, but instead want to spread the idea that kindness will get you to exactly where you want to be - and with a clearer conscience.
Post 9: What playing Tennis has taught you?
Agenda: You were a semi-professional Tennis player, so if you can share something on that experience - how it helped you personally or further pushed you to pursue something you were passionate about.
Suggested visual: Picture from one of your Tennis tournaments.
As a former professional tennis athlete, I've always believed that the true strength of an athlete lies not just in their physical prowess but in their mental resilience. The experiences I gained on the tennis court have been instrumental in shaping my mental toughness, a quality that continues to impact my career and everyday life.
1. Facing Pressure Head-On: Tennis is often a solitary sport, with no teammates to share the responsibility. The ability to handle the pressure and take ownership of my performance taught me to face challenges head-on in my career, with confidence and composure.
2. Embracing Adversity: Tennis matches can turn in an instant, and the ability to bounce back from setbacks became second nature. In my career, I've learned to embrace adversity as an opportunity for growth and development.
3. Persistence Amidst Failure: Tennis taught me that failure is not the end; it's a stepping stone to success. The countless hours of practice and matches instilled in me the persistence to keep pushing forward, no matter the obstacles in my path.
4. Focus and Concentration: In tennis, losing focus for even a moment can be costly. I've carried over this ability to maintain intense concentration into my professional life, ensuring that I stay on track and deliver my best in every task.
5. Resilience in the Face of Uncertainty: Tennis often requires adapting to different playing conditions, opponents, and game strategies. This adaptability has made me resilient in the ever-changing landscape of my career.
The mental toughness developed during my years as a tennis professional has been a defining factor in my journey, and I'm thankful for the invaluable lessons it has bestowed. It's a reminder that the lessons learned on the court go far beyond the game itself and continue to shape our personal and professional lives.
I'd love to hear from others who have harnessed their athletic experiences to develop mental toughness. How has your sports background influenced your career and everyday life?
Post 10: How your parents supported you and believed in your dream when you were just starting out?
Agenda: To show that the support of your parents has played a big part in your career.
Suggested visual: A picture of you with your parents.
My success today is because of the belief my parents had in me from day one. I definitely wasn’t an academic growing up (which for a girl from an Indian family, wasn’t ideal!). Yet my parents never pressured me. They understood I was into my sports and the more practical subjects.
They made me believe I could do anything. And I never once doubted their support for me.
So when I was unemployed and asked them to financially support me so I can follow my dreams - they didn’t even hesitate to do so.
It’s now been 10 years since I graduated. I’m now living in a different country than where I grew up, thousands of miles away from my parents, doing the job they always knew I could do.
All this to say, although I’m not a parent as of yet - I understand the utmost power of a parent’s ability to unwaveringly support their child. I believed I could because they believed I could. I never doubted myself because they never doubted me.
My parents were my inner voice. And that inner voice eventually became my outer voice.
A voice which I’m so proud to have nurtured and built with them.
Post 11: How our voice can be moulded for better public speaking?
Agenda: To tell how the variations in our voice matter - the tone, pitch, and depth and how it can be improved.
Suggested visual: A picture from any public-speaking event.
Our voice is a dynamic instrument that can significantly impact the success of our public speaking engagements. The variations in our tone, pitch, and depth play a crucial role in delivering a compelling message.
Here's why they matter and how we can enhance our vocal skills for effective communication:
🔵 Tone Matters: The emotional context of your message is conveyed through your tone. Whether it's enthusiasm, empathy, authority, or another emotion, your tone shapes how your audience interprets your message. Practice emotional awareness and study great speakers to master this essential aspect of communication.
🟣 Pitch Adds Emphasis: Varying your pitch can infuse excitement, emphasis, and interest into your speech. A monotone delivery can make your message less engaging. Explore pitch range exercises, vocal warm-ups, and visual cues to keep your audience captivated.
🟤 Depth Reflects Confidence: Resonance or depth in your voice can exude authority and confidence. A deep, resonant voice captures attention and makes your message more compelling. Work on your diaphragmatic breathing, projection, and vocal exercises to harness this powerful aspect of your voice.
🌟 Practical Steps:
Record yourself speaking and evaluate your tone, pitch, and resonance.
Experiment with different emotional tones and pitch levels in practice sessions.
Seek feedback from mentors and peers to refine your vocal skills.
Mastering these voice variations can transform your public speaking prowess, making your messages more engaging and memorable.
Post 12: Your interview with Tyra Banks.
Agenda: To highlight your interview and your take on confidence.
Suggested visual: Your picture with Tyra Banks.
Tyra Banks is the true definition of CONFIDENCE.
I watched her growing up, thinking… “Wow. She’s so powerful”
So when I got to meet her and interview her - you can only imagine my excitement.
They say you should be careful to meet your idols, so you’re not disappointed. But my goodness, my expectations were fulfilled and then some.
Tyra was so kind, had the presence of the sun & spoke with so much conviction.
That’s a role model. Someone who genuinely practises what they preach, an individual who admits to not being perfect but determined to be the best version of themselves.
When I asked her “What does Confidence mean to you?”
Her answer: “Even when you’re scared, still doing it.”
So if you’re feeling scared or anxious about a potential life/career change - still do it.
It’s worked for Tyra Banks, it’ll work for you!

Social media cleansing - statistics on consumption, effect on your psychology
Topic 1: Top 3 things to do before the new year.
Agenda: To encourage your followers to take action and prepare for a successful year ahead.
Suggested visual: Any candid picture of yours.
Another year is coming to an end and most of us (including myself) are still processing how fast the time passed by.
But instead of letting the calendar pressure get to you, here is what you can do before singing the countdown to 2024:
1) Reflect & refresh:
Take a few minutes to reflect on where you went right or wrong this whole time, what worked for you or not, and how you can make it even better.
2) Vision & vibration:
Visualise how you want your 2024 to be, what your desires are, define clear goals and set those vibes right.
3) Action & accountability:
Hold on to that vision of yours and start working towards it.
You don’t have to do it all in one go but step-by-step start ticking them off your list.
Be the Picasso of your life and paint the picture as you like.
Happy countdown to 2024!
Topic 2: How to be productive this January?
Agenda: To share practical strategies for staying focused and achieving goals.
Suggested visual: Any candid picture of yours (if you could click one with the January calendar in hand, that would look nice).
For many of us, January is like a mountain of resolutions and to-do lists, am I right?
Seeing people around all charged up with enthusiasm and productivity hacks, may make you feel like you are lagging behind.
Don’t worry, I am going to tell you how you can make your January productive and not feel guilty by the end of it:
1) Tiny goals, big impact:
Break down your year-long aspirations into bite-sized daily wins.
Celebrate small wins to keep the momentum going.
2) Schedule like a boss:
Make time-blocking your January BFF.
Divide your day into focused work sprints, guilt-free breaks, and movement.
Remember, a rested you is a productive you. ‍
3) Tech to the rescue:
Embrace the power of apps.
From to-do lists to time trackers, there is a tool for everything.
Remember, you don’t have to give in to the pressure;
It will only cause you burnout.
Figure out what works best for you and stick to it.
Topic 3: Don’t just make resolutions, rather set intentions for a meaningful year.
Agenda: To discuss the importance of setting intentions rather than resolutions, focusing on purpose and alignment with core values.
Suggested visual: Any candid picture of yours.
The countdown to 2024 is on and it’s high time we ditch the generic ‘new year, new me’ resolutions.
While resolutions feel good in the moment, they often lack the motivation to carry us through the year's inevitable roadblocks.
According to research* 23% of people quit their resolutions by the end of the first week, and 43% quit by the end of January.
So, this 2024, I am proposing to ditch the resolutions and embrace intentions.
Instead of rigid to-do lists, let us set guiding principles that resonate with our core values.
Think of intentions as the compass to your meaningful year.
They are not about checking boxes, but about why you are checking them.
What kind of impact do you want to make? How do you want to feel - fulfilled, energised, connected?
You see, intentions are flexible.
They can bend and adapt as life unfolds, unlike resolutions.
They are not about perfection, but about progress, about showing up as your most authentic self, every messy, beautiful step of the way.
So, what intentions are you setting for yourself this 2024?
* Research: https: https://fisher.osu.edu/blogs/leadreadtoday/why-most-new-years-resolutions-fail
Topic 4: How to set micro goals for maximum effectiveness?
Agenda: To showcase the effectiveness of setting small and achievable goals.
Suggested visual: Any picture of yours from an event, presenting.
I often feel that the pressure of achieving ‘big goals’ sucks the life out of motivation.
We set those ‘big goals’ at the start of the year and struggle to keep up with them.
I have done that and trust me, it can get tiring (both mentally and physically).
So instead of aiming for Mount Everest, I started with a pebble climb.
Simply put, don’t go for big goals but micro goals.
These tiny, achievable steps are like magic stairs to your dreams.
In addition to that, daily habits string these tiny wins together.
For instance,
You want to write a book? Write 200 words daily.
Want to run a marathon for the first time? Start walking for 10 minutes daily.
When a habit is formed, momentum builds eventually.
And, these small steps, when taken consistently, lead to big results.
Consistency is the key, my friends.
Micro goals help you show up, even when the self-doubt clouds your motivation.
What tiny step will you take towards your big dream today?
Topic 5: 3-5 impactful and motivational books.
Agenda: To recommend 3-5 impactful books on mindset, motivation, and personal development. If you could tell us some book names, it would be helpful.
Suggested visual: Any picture of you with any of the recommended books.
There are days when all you need is a “pick-me-up” book and a cup of coffee.
I love reading a book that leaves me smiling and all energised with motivation.
Since I usually get asked about what books I indulge in,
Here are 3 mindset-shifting reads that I highly recommend:
""Mindset: The New Psychology of Success"" by Carol Dweck:
Ever heard of ‘growth mindset’?
This one is all about the power of believing in your potential and how that belief shapes your entire journey.
""Daring Greatly"" by Brené Brown:
Vulnerability is a strength.
This book is a love letter to courage and authenticity, reminding us that showing up as our true selves is the bravest thing we can do.
""The Happiness Project"" by Gretchen Rubin:
Ever feel like happiness is just out of reach?
This book is your roadmap, filled with practical tips and experiments to boost your joy and well-being.
If you have got other great reads then hit me with the recommendations in the comments.
Topic 6: Social media detox or how to unplug to recharge.
Agenda: Discuss the benefits of taking breaks from social media.
Suggested visual: Any picture of you indulged in some non-social media activity (playing a sport or maybe in a garden watering plants).
Our brains are wired for connection, but constant digital dopamine hits leave us drained out.
Between the curated feeds, the endless scroll, and the constant comparison trap, social media can be a real energy sucker.
I remember a time when all that scrolling and swiping wasn't just draining my battery, it was zapping my soul.
So, I unplugged.
And guess what?
I reconnected with the real world, my creativity was at its peak, and I was genuinely at peace from the inside.
So, let's talk about social media detox.
Taking a social media detox isn't about disappearing forever, it is about reclaiming your energy, your focus, and your own narrative.
So, how do we do this?
Start small: ditch the phone at dinner, silence notifications, or set ""digital sunset"" times.
Then, fill the void with real-life adventures.
Take a walk, read a book, have a picnic under the stars, go to the beach, meet a friend, or try a new hobby.
Trust me, your creativity, your productivity, your soul - they will all thank you for it.
Now, excuse me while I go unplug and recharge.
Topic 7: Travel and exploration of new places.
Agenda: To discuss the importance of travel and exploring new places for personal growth and inspiration. If you can share any personal experience of visiting a new city/ country and how it was, it would be helpful.
Suggested visual: Any picture of you from that place/ city/ country.
We chase, chase, chase in this world, don't we?
The best job, the biggest house, the most Insta-worthy moments.
A while ago, in the midst of this ""end-of-year-goals"" frenzy, stressed, I travelled to Cambodia.
And, I have come to the conclusion that travelling isn't just ticking landmarks off a bucket list.
It is like a reset button for our soul.
Here, these photos are a beautiful reminder of what truly matters.
They show me. Not as a hustler, a chaser, a doer.
But as a seeker.
Someone simply wanting to connect with something bigger than herself.
In that space, surrounded by such unbelievable calm, I was overflowing with gratitude.
It was like the world just melted away, and all that was left was this quiet, beautiful peace.
You know this is what I love about travelling - you never know what you are going to discover.
Share your soul-searching travel tales in the comments below.
Topic 8: The importance of gratitude in life.
Agenda: To discuss the power of practising gratitude for increased happiness and well-being by sharing your personal experience.
Suggested visual: A picture of you writing in your journal.
Ironically, I wasn't always Ms. Thankful.
I used to be a bit grumpy.
Always chasing the next big thing, comparing my hectic life to everyone else's perfectly styled lives.
But then, something shifted.
I started keeping a gratitude journal, scribbling down even the tiniest things -
That morning chai that warmed my soul, the stranger's unexpected smile, the laughter shared with loved ones.
And guess what?
Gratitude became my superpower.
It turned my frown upside down, not just for a fleeting moment, but for real.
I woke up each day with a heart full of sunshine, ready to see the good stuff everywhere.
My relationships deepened, my creativity blossomed, and even the smallest moments felt a little more…magical.
You know, even science backs it!
Practising gratitude boosts happiness, reduces stress, and makes us overall productive.
So, take a moment each day, big or small, to appreciate the good stuff, the not-so-good stuff, and everything in between.
You might just surprise yourself with how much sunshine you find amidst the clouds.
Topic 9: How to carve your social circle and build a network that supports your growth?
Agenda: To discuss the importance of surrounding yourself with positive and supportive people who share your values and inspire you.
Suggested visual: Any group picture with your loved ones/ friends/ family.
Ever feel like your social circle is a mixed bag of chips - some crunchy and inspiring, others… bland and soggy.
Over the years I have realised that who you surround yourself with shapes your journey.
Our social circles are like gardens.
You gotta weed out the wilted connections and cultivate the ones that make you bloom.
So, how do we sculpt a squad that lifts us up?
Plant seeds of intention:
Who inspires you? Who challenges you? Seek out those souls, even if it feels awkward at first.
Water with shared values:
Surround yourself with people who get your fire, not those who try to dim it.
Prune with honesty:
Don't be afraid to let go of connections that drain your energy. It's okay to say ""thanks, but no thanks"" to negativity.
But, this whole positive networking thing isn't just about taking - it is about giving back too.
You need to be the cheerleader, the mentor, the hype person in someone else's story as well.
Topic 10: Top 3 podcasts to watch
Agenda: Nimi’s monthly pick of podcasts
Suggested visual: Visual of her watching a podcast
I am always on the hunt for inspiring content that leaves me feeling like I can actually tackle that to-do list on a Monday morning (even without my coffee).
Lately, two podcasts have rocketed to the top of my ""Must-Listen"" queue, and I just had to share with you:
Emily Jaenson's ""Six Behaviours to Increase Your Confidence""
She lays out six simple yet powerful habits that helped her conquer her own confidence clouds.
This powerhouse speaker breaks down confidence into bite-sized, actionable steps, like ""taking a seat at the table"" and ""cheering for others' success.""
It's a total confidence-booster shot straight to the soul!
Abby Wambach's ""We Can Do Hard Things"" episode, ""Why Can't I Love Myself?""
Now, this one hits different.
Abby, the soccer superstar, gets real about starting therapy and facing uncomfortable emotions like anger and sadness.
It is a reminder that even the most badass humans struggle with self-love, and that's totally okay.
What are your go-to podcasts for a confidence boost?
Topic 11: Nimi’s Curation Page
Agenda: To Explain what it is etc
Suggested visual: Picture of her on her laptop with the page open

HAIR DENSITY TONIC BANNER CHANGES3. Text Change in Hormonal, Genetic & Cellular- Here we have a change in the heading- Content changes made to highlight the ingredient that is solving the issue in each scenario.
Hormonal Hair LossThe hormonal impact of hair fall is mainly initiated by “Testosterone”. This is a male dominanthormone, present in both men & women. When this hormone interacts with an enzyme called 5 Alpha Reductase, it gets converted to Dehydrotestosterone (DHT) at the Hair bulb. This combination then leads to hair loss. The Hair Density Tonic helps in controlling & blocking the 5 Alpha Reductase enzyme. It contains Procapil, a plant-derived active that acts as a DHT blocker. It causes an impactful reduction in the DHT formation. Hence, the hair loss decreases visibly.
Cellular ImbalancesAt cellular level it is essential to regulate the signal transduction pathway for stimulating the receptors involved in signalling hair growth & controlling hair fall. Here, we need to understand the role of R-spondin 1 which is a protein involved in the regeneration of organs and tissue. In hair science, R-spondin 1 activates hair follicle stem cells and accelerates hair regeneration. This protein also works as a strong barrier against hair loss, creating a balanceThe Hair Density Tonic contains a Japanese clinically proven active Burgeon UP that works at the most advance level to promote the secretion of R-spondin 1 from Dermal Papilla Cells to stimulate hair growth while also preventing hair loss.Genetic Hair GrowthAt this level, the hair growth is affected due to genes.  There are certain genes that are involved in the production of bodily Amino Acid. These genes interfere with various receptor signals and disrupt the balance or ratio between the receptors. This in turn hampers the hair growth at genetic level. The Hair Density Tonic works to create that balance & sets the ratio back in place. Its formulation is acohesive solution containing Wheat & Soy Amino Acids with additional Pure Amino Acids. These are carefully selected to mimic the functional ratios in human hair Amino Acids. This helps in bringing back the balance and initiating the healthy growth phase of hair.

Such sun explosure not only impacts your hair’s colour and texture but it also weakens your hair’s protein structure, impacting them internally. It makes hair dry & reduces elasticity, which leads to hair breakage.  When combined with wind, heat, pollution and more, it further damages your hair.Image: We-transfer Link image option of two women in sun

At The Earth Collective, we have revolutionised the basic approach to hair care! After meticulous research, numerous studies, rigorous testing & user feedback, we have developed a holistic approach to hair care that is inspired by powerful natural ingredients.

Post 1: New idea to be discussed: Talk honestly about coming here after 3 years in the business. Till now been more of a silent observer but now I have some experience, if not alot to share. With many ups, downs, pandemic things just kept changing and now have the experience to talk about my journey as an entrepreneur.

Post 1: Perceptions of an Entrepreneur: Striving for Collaboration and Success
Agenda: Introduce yourself as an entrepreneur who believes in being actively involved in every aspect of the business while fostering a collaborative environment. Share thoughts on the importance of teamwork and gathering insights from others to drive growth and success.
Suggested Visual:An image of you speaking with your team
How to thrive as an entrepreneur?
Always be hands-on and actively involved in every aspect of your business.
Having said that, you need to learn to trust & depend on your team.
For me, personally, whether it is brainstorming new ideas or tackling challenges, I always look to my team for valuable inputs.
Why does it help?
Brings diverse perspectives and insights
Leads to new ideas and possibilities
Drives growth and success
Also, being open to collaboration as the leader promotes a sense of ownership within the team.
This has been my experience so far, would love to hear your inputs!
Post 2:  Me as an Entrepreneur why I am starting on LinkedIn
Agenda:
Her perspective around how she was silent for sometime
Started few days back before lockdown
Why she is starting on LinkedIn
Suggested Visual: Only text
How tough it is now to start
OR It can be tough to begin a new journey
Just when I had embarked on my journey into the entrepreneurial world, lockdown knocked us.
All this while, I have been the silent spectator - soaking in insights and navigating the ever-changing business landscape.
Now, after wearing multiple hats and weathering the storm of uncertainties - I am here to open up about my entrepreneurial escapades.
Why on LinkedIn, you ask?
Well, this platform resonates with my commitment to being hands-on in every aspect of my business.From brainstorming innovative products to fine-tuning operational nitty-gritties - I have been lucky enough to do it all.
These experiences have empowered me to make informed decisions that take my venture forward.
For me, the term ""entrepreneur"" isn't just a label; it symbolises a commitment to leveraging my insights and experiences to help others thrive. As I embark on this new phase of sharing my learnings, I look forward to fostering a community of learning, growth, and mutual support.
Post 3: Designing the Perfect Brand: Design & Brand Experience - A Vision of Attainable Luxury
Agenda: Share your domain expertise in design principles and how you applied them to create a brand that defines ""attainable luxury."" Discuss the importance of aesthetics in marketing and brand communication, for TEC in a very 101 manner.
Suggested Visual: You with a packaging of your product
When I started The Earth Collective, I made sure the brand aesthetics were on point.
For me, it wasn't just about having a pretty design.
It was about creating an experience that resonates with our customers while meeting all international guidelines.
We decided to embrace the power of colour to narrate our brand's story.
Imagine this: every hue of packaging intricately tied to the essence of hair concerns, forming a unique visual language.
Our decision to go with a colour-based branding strategy wasn't just about looks.
But a symbol of alignment and creating a memorable identity.
For The Earth Collective, aesthetics aren't just about what meets the eye, but what makes it desirable.
Post 4 : The Changing Work Culture: Embracing Office Environment
Agenda: Discuss the benefits of being physically present in the office, and how it contributes to increased productivity, in the age of wfh.
Suggested Visual: An image of you working with your team in office
The “work from home v/s work from office” debate is still not settled.
Personally, I have come to appreciate the benefits of being physically present in the office all the more after the pandemic.
With remote work, it is easy to overlook the impact that face-to-face interactions can have on productivity.
However, being in the office allows for:
Clear understanding of tasks
Spontaneous discussions
Better teamwork
While remote work can be convenient, it is easier to build relationships and establish trust with colleagues when you are interacting in person.
All of this can lead to improved collaboration, increased morale, and ultimately, higher productivity.
Post 5 :  Resourceful Post: The Joy of Travel and Unwinding
Agenda: Sharing your personalised insights and tips on the joy of travel and its impact on personal growth.
Suggested Visual: A travel Pic
Travel is the best form of education.
For years, travelling has always been my go-to method for
→ unwinding
→ learning
→ connecting with both myself and my loved ones
It is a much-needed experience away from the monotonous routine of everyday life.
The opportunity to explore different cultures, cuisines, and histories allows me to broaden my horizons.
One may not realise that when you travel, you also gain interpersonal skills.
Believe me, travel is your best teacher not only in terms of exposure to history, culture & language, but also to discover yourself.
Post 6 :  Why Haircare?
Suggested Visual: An image showcasing the diversity of hair types in India
Why just hair care? This is a question I am asked most.
Growing up I was very  experimental with my hair. Almost fearless. One simple cut or a bunch of streaks, and my whole look would just change. Hair to me always felt like the quickest and simplest way to express how I look.
And over time after all these experiments, I realised that I do need proper hair care to help my hair overcome all that I put it through. While doing so, I also wondered why people do not give as much importance to hair as they do for, say skin or make-up.
Skin care and makeup varies according to your skin type, concerns  and so does hair care. But if you notice closely, one family might have different skin care products suited to their needs but almost all use the same shampoo and conditioner, despite different hair types.
The Earth Collective was born out of a vision to fill this gap and help people understand the importance of scalp and hair care. To ping them to pay attention and see what their hair needs depending on their hair type, concerns and even lifestyle.
Our approach is to embrace the diverse hair types and curate products suited to needs and concerns. And living here, in India, we have such diverse hair types and unique needs, that I never felt the need to explore any other category, until I am sure I have covered all my aces when it comes to hair care.
Edited:
""Why hair care? It's a question I often hear.
Growing up, I fearlessly experimented with my hair, realising it was my canvas for self-expression. But while doing this,  I also understood the need for proper hair care. I’ve always wondered why haircare receives less attention than skincare and makeup.
Skincare and makeup cater to individual needs, and hair care should too. Yet, in many households, everyone uses the same shampoo despite varying hair types within families. Face wash isn’t interchangeable, why should shampoo be?
The Earth Collective was born to bridge this gap, emphasising scalp and hair care's importance. We urge people to understand their hair's unique requirements based on type, concerns, and lifestyle.
Our approach is to celebrate diverse hair types, curating products that address individual needs. In India, with its diverse hair types and unique demands, I've focused solely on perfecting hair care.

Post 1: Lessons in Patience: Building a Sustainable Business
Agenda: To share the inspiring story of your father-in-law's journey and how it serves as a powerful reminder to focus on consistent growth and trust in the process.
Suggested Visual: An image with him if possible
Post Description:
It was one of those ‘low-day’ moments when my husband shared an inspiring story about his father building a successful cosmetic brand, Sofia.
In the early days, the internet and marketing were far-fetched concepts, but that didn't stop him from succeeding.
Instead, he focused on exceptional product quality and relied on word-of-mouth publicity.
Within five years, Sofia became a successful brand.
These days, we often chase instant results and overlook the value of time in sustainable growth.
We forget that entrepreneurship isn't a race but a marathon.
It takes perseverance, dedication, and the willingness to invest in our vision.
My husband taught me that by consistently delivering quality products and building trust, we lay the foundation for lasting success.
Truly, the support and expertise of my husband have been one of the anchors in my entrepreneurial journey.
Post 2: The Intriguing World of AI: Enhancing Human Capabilities
Agenda: Talk about how AI can make processes more efficient, improve decision-making, and personalise experiences. While acknowledging its power, emphasise the importance of human oversight and judgement in conjunction with AI.
Suggested Visual: You prompting ChatGPT
<Can this be a created visual - https://www.freepik.com/free-photo/opened-ai-chat-laptop_38259334.htm#query=chat%20gpt%20ai%20technology%20using%20on%20phone&position=28&from_view=search&track=ais >
AI has caught everyone’s attention, and I just couldn't stay away due to my FOMO.
The impact of AI on our lives is huge - driving efficiency, sharpening decision-making, and even personalising our experiences.
Though AI may appear daunting, it is essential to embrace its potential and integrate it into our lives.
I did give it a try and observed that using AI saved us a lot of time and effort.
However, we must strive to combine human judgement & oversight with the power of AI
This technology should be leveraged with the right balance.
Post 3: Aparajita Awards - Supported by The Earth Collective

Post 4 : Celebrating Diversity in Hair Care
Agenda: To address the diversity that exists in hair types & concerns, especially in a diverse country like India. The focus will then shift to how The Earth Collective was created to celebrate & provide individualised hair care solutions.
Suggested Visual: Image of an Indian grandmother oiling her grand daughter’s hair
Growing up in this beautiful nation, I was always struck by the incredible variety of hair textures, colours, and styles that surrounded me.
India is a land of vibrant cultures, languages, and traditions, and our hair is an integral part of this rich mosaic of diversity.
Yet, I noticed a gap – a gap in the representation and acknowledgment of this remarkable diversity in the world of hair care. With an incredible diversity of different hair types, concerns, and genetic & environmental factors, we need diversity in our approach to hair care.
The Earth Collective was born out of a vision to fill this gap and provide a platform where every Indian could find products and solutions tailored to their unique hair needs.
Our approach is rooted in the belief that embracing diversity goes beyond token gestures; it's about crafting products that truly address the spectrum of concerns our nation faces.
One example that perfectly encapsulates this is our collective tradition of oiling our hair.  Not only is this an excellent hair care practice, but is something that’s also strongly rooted in our culture.  What I also noticed was a strong bent towards a particular ingredient in the oil - Coconut, Almond, Amla - people have been very specific to buying an oil as per the ingredient.
And so, when we worked on our range of products we had to include a range of hair oils. And from this range, my favourite is the 18 in 1 hair oil because it is one oil that has it all.
Hence, our product offerings include a range of hair oils, featuring combinations of powerful natural ingredients for the Indian consumer.
Post 5: How to Find Work-Life Balance as A woman especially: Striking the Right Balance
Agenda: Tips and advice on finding the right work-life balance from your experience of being a female entrepreneur.
Suggested Visual: A family picture at the office
<Can we use a created visual, a vector - https://www.freepik.com/search?format=search&last_filter=type&last_value=vector&query=work%20life%20balance%20women&type=vector >
All that noise about work-life balance - is it even attainable?
No doubt we are driven and passionate about our ventures.
But it is vital to strike a balance so that family and personal life don’t take a backseat.
As a woman, here’s what I do to balance out both work & home fronts:
Time management is the key
Delegate tasks to your team
Learn to say 'no' to tasks that overwhelm you
Set clear boundaries between work and personal time
Make time for self-care and hobbies to recharge
Seek support from family and friends
Remember, we are more than just entrepreneurs.
Along with growing a company, we have to learn to manage other aspects of our lives!
Post 6: Trends that Intrigued Me: Celebrity Endorsed Brands and Scalp Care Focus
Agenda: Share opinions on recent trends in the industry. Discuss the growth of celebrity-endorsed brands and its impact on the Indian market, emphasising the competition it presents. Additionally, Also highlight the growing focus on scalp care in the industry and how The Earth Collective has been striving to address this need
Suggested Visual: You holding A celebrity endorsed brand product or you looking at Instagram
<Would be good if we can create a visual with the logos of some popular International and Indian Beauty Brands>
The ever-changing digital landscape in our industry has kept me on my toes.
However, there are two trends that have particularly caught my attention lately.
Celebrity brand endorsements
There have been many celebrity brand endorsements earlier but Kylie Jenner’s brand really took the market by storm.
And now, brands like Kay Beauty by Katrina Kaif or 82°E by Deepika Padukone have carved a prominent space in the Indian market.
The recent entry of Rare Beauty into India speaks volumes about the impact of celebrity branding.
It is certainly something we need to watch out for as it will have a big influence on our market.
Increased focus on scalp care
With each passing quarter, new brands and products focus on scalp health as much as skincare.
At The Earth Collective, we have been passionate about addressing this crucial need.
It is heartening to see the industry aligning with our vision.
Post 7: Balancing Digital Growth: Addressing Challenges in the D2C Domain
Agenda: Discuss the rapid growth of the D2C personal care industry in India and the opportunities it offers. Address the challenges faced by start-up brands, such as the need for offline presence, managing costs in retail shelf space, and maintaining authenticity amidst trends and influencer collaborations.
Suggested Visual: An image from an invent
a
The growth of D2C brands has been phenomenal.
This is largely due to increased consumer trust and acceptance of homegrown products.
Meta, Google, and Instagram have been vital in growing our customer base and we are grateful for that.
However, there are some challenges faced by start-ups in this domain:
The costs and credit involved in retail shelf space can be daunting for bootstrapped brands.
Initially, homegrown brand partnerships with content creators were common, but conglomerate collaborations raised commercial stakes.
We need more transparency in the industry and a greater focus on authenticity.
At The Earth Collective, we remain focused on our expertise as Hair Specialists; offering the best for your hair.
Our motto - simplify hair care for our audience.

Post 1 : Practical Experience: Lessons from Launching a Successful Product
Agenda: Share your hands-on experience in product development, formulation, and brand building. List the common mistakes entrepreneurs make in the hair care industry, along with practical solutions for successful launches.
Suggested Visual: Image from your manufacturing unit
<We would not have an image of Shaily in the unit, but we can use the product manufacturing shot from the manufacturing page created on the website>
Nowadays, many brands have diversified their portfolios with multiple categories and product lines.
However, this approach often leads to a shift in focus and dilution of brand identity.
That's why, at The Earth Collective, we made a conscious decision to establish ourselves as ""The Hair Specialist"" from the very beginning.
By doing so, we ensure that we never lose sight of our core expertise in scalp and hair care.
For instance, our bestsellers like Hair Density Tonic &  Co-wash are designed to address specific hair & scalp concerns.
Our dedication and commitment to this niche allows us to deliver noticeable results through tailored solutions for our clients & customers at large.
Post 2: Overcoming distractions: Staying focused in the digital age
We live in a world of information overload and the constant fear of missing out (FOMO).
Here are my top three techniques to avoid distractions and increase productivity:
The Eisenhower Matrix:
Prioritise tasks into four categories: Urgent and important, important but not urgent, urgent but not important, neither urgent nor important.
Focus on the important tasks, not just the urgent ones.
Digital minimalism:
Regularly declutter your digital space.
Unsubscribe from unnecessary email lists, unfollow distracting social media accounts, and delete apps you rarely use.
The 5-second rule:
When you feel the urge to procrastinate or give in to distractions, count backward from 5 to 1, and then take action.
This helps you break the cycle of procrastination.
Remember, overcoming distractions is an ongoing process and not just a one-time thing.
Post 3: Your leadership philosophy about teamwork.
Agenda: To share your opinion that leaders should trust their team, delegate, welcome ideas, and have open communication.
Suggested visual: Any picture of yours with the team.
In my journey as a leader, I have realised that true success lies in teamwork.
I truly believe that leaders should trust their teams, empower them to make decisions and take ownership.
After all, a team is at its best when each member feels valued and empowered.
Another thing I have observed is that by encouraging dialogue, we were able tackle challenges head-on and find innovative solutions together.
Problems only grow bigger when ignored.
But when we address them openly and calmly, we harness the collective wisdom of our team for faster resolutions.
Mistakes are part of the game and are actually opportunities for learning and improvement.
My approach is to support my team, find solutions, and ensure we learn from every misstep.
After all, in a culture of trust and mutual respect, we grow stronger together.
Post 4: Why consumers must not give in to ‘following a trend’?
Agenda: To share your view point that what works for one, may not work for another and consumers should avoid running after trends blindly.
Suggested visual: Any picture from your work.
I come across new trends every other day.
However, in a world driven by trends and fads, it is important to remember that what works for others may not work for you; and that is perfectly fine.
I truly value the importance of having an individuality.
Following trends blindly in the haircare and beauty industry might not always be the best route.
Sure, a trendy product or ingredient might do wonders for someone with a specific concern or goal, but we are all wonderfully unique.
We should approach our haircare and beauty routines with mindfulness and care.
One should consider their own unique needs and preferences, rather than just chasing what is trending.
At The Earth Collective, we have mindfully designed unique products for specific concerns to provide the best for your hair.
Post 5: Your productivity mantra - time management and patience.
Agenda: To share how you manage your tasks and keep pushing forward regardless of challenges.
Suggested visual: Any candid picture of yours.
Often, I observe people trying to keep up with tasks while constantly struggling.
However, I have found that time management and patience can be a real game-changer.
Here's how I try to remain productive, no matter what challenges life throws at me:
Prioritise tasks:
Identify the critical and the not-so-critical ones.
Start with the important things followed by others.
Break tasks into bite-sized chunks:
Batch and block your time - piece by piece, it all comes together.
Like Sam Levenson once said, ""Don't watch the clock; do what it does. Keep going.""
Post 6: Your learnings from your low-moment.
Agenda: If you can share any setback and how you overcame it, it would be helpful.
Here we can talk of how, as any other brand , we have seen some low months and during that time we just sit back and think of what we did previously that worked, what we might be missing out on and need to work on. Lots of times we try new things with a lot of hope and not everything pans out.
Suggested visual: Any casual picture of yours.
<Can we give this another go please..at the end it is coming across as we do not recommend experimenting.>
Let's be real, we all have had those low moments in our professional journey.
Just like any brand, we have had our fair share of challenges as well.
Initially, there were a few months where things just didn't seem to go our way.
We took a step back, reflected on our past successes, and analysed what went right and what didn’t.
Despite setbacks, our every attempt was a learning experience.
But here is the beauty of it - it is all about the process.
We try, learn, and grow!
November
Post  1: The time when you launched The Hair Density Tonic.
Agenda: To share how you were able to launch the product successfully despite the challenges while highlighting your strength and expertise.
Suggested visual: The picture of the product (hair density tonic).
At The Earth Collective, I have had the privilege of launching several successful products over the years, but one that was most challenging & rewarding was our Hair Density Tonic.
In the midst of the pandemic, our DMs were flooded with customer concerns about excessive hair fall, a direct result post-covid stress that their bodies had gone through..
We knew we had to act quickly to provide a solution, but with supply chain disruptions and logistical hurdles, it seemed like an impossible task.
Fortunately, our team's combined expertise rose to the occasion;
Ensuring that we sourced the best ingredients and adhered to all safety protocols.
The result?
The Hair Density Tonic quickly became our best-selling product, helping countless customers regain their confidence and hair health. It tackled not just the issue of hair loss, but all hair growth. It helped provide a solution against all three causes of hair loss - Hormonal, Genetic & Cellular
This was a very successful launch, and it is where I feel our expertise came to play at the right place, at the right time.
With a background in design and a deep understanding of the cosmetic manufacturing industry, we were able to bring our strengths together to create a product that people love.
Post 2: How and why entrepreneurs like yourself should support mental health well-being.
Agenda: If you can share any personal experience regarding the same or have any tips, it would be helpful.
Suggested visual: Any candid picture of yours.
As an entrepreneur in the haircare industry, I am constantly juggling the demands of running a business while maintaining a creative vision.
It is a whirlwind of excitement and passion but it can also get overwhelming.
While the hustle and bustle of building a successful brand can be exhilarating, it is crucial to remember that our mental well-being is the foundation upon which our success is built.
Here's why it is crucial for entrepreneurs like us to prioritize our mental health:
1) Clarity and creativity:
When our minds are clear and calm, we are better equipped to make sound decisions and tap into our creative genius.
2) Resilience and perseverance:
A strong mental foundation helps us bounce back from setbacks and keep pushing forward in our entrepreneurial journey.
3) Empowering others:
By prioritizing our mental health, we set an example for our team, clients, and fellow entrepreneurs, encouraging them to do the same.
Creating a more supportive and inclusive haircare industry where mental well-being is valued and nurtured is the need of the hour.
Post 3: Business Standard Publication

Post  4: The growing trend of peptides in hair growth serums - but is it actually good or harmful?
Agenda: To tell your opinion on the huge trend with brands introducing hair products with peptides and other chemicals. We can also portray how thoughtfully the products are made at The Earth Collective.
Suggested visual: Any image of the best-selling products.
Peptides are the latest thing to hit the haircare industry.
What are they?
Peptides are short chains of amino acids which are the building blocks of proteins.
They are said to stimulate hair growth, improve hair texture, and reduce hair loss.
But do peptides really work?
Some experts say that there is not enough scientific evidence to support the claims that peptides can promote hair growth.
Others say that peptides may be effective for some people, but not for others.
So, is it worth investing in a peptide hair growth serum?
Well, that depends on your individual hair concerns and goals.
If you are looking for a quick fix, peptides may not be the answer for you.
However, if you are willing to be patient and consistent, peptides may be worth a try.
At The Earth Collective, we take a different approach to hair care.
We believe in using ingredients that are gentle on your hair and scalp.
We don't believe in using harsh chemicals or synthetic ingredients that can damage your hair.
P.S. If you are considering using a peptide-based hair growth serum, be sure to do your research and choose a product that is made with high-quality ingredients.
pepPost 5: Why the 4Ps of marketing are important and how you have accounted for those.
Agenda: To highlight your expertise and educate the audience on the 4Ps - product, price, promotion, and place - and what was your thought process on this when you established the brand.
After reading this, it seems very basic. I mean the insights here are something anyone would write about when it comes to the 4P’s of marketing. Either we look at creating this completely with product led examples from our line/ hair care industry overall  or we can change the topic as well.
Suggested visual: TEC brand logo picture.
In the world of marketing, the 4Ps - product, price, place, and promotion - stand as fundamental pillars.
While these concepts may seem straightforward, applying them effectively requires a deep understanding of consumer behaviour and market dynamics.
At The Earth Collective, we have embraced the 4Ps as our guiding principles, ensuring that our products, pricing, distribution, and marketing strategies align seamlessly with our mission of sustainable living.
Here are some of the ways we have accounted for the 4Ps at The Earth Collective:
1) Product: We have created a product that is both innovative and sustainable, using only the highest quality ingredients and packaging.
2) Price: We have carefully considered our pricing to ensure that our products are both affordable and profitable.
3) Place: We have partnered with a network of retailers and distributors to ensure that our products are available to our target audience.
4) Promotion: We are using a variety of marketing channels, including social media, influencer marketing, and public relations, to promote our products.
We are committed to continuing to use this framework to create marketing strategies that are both innovative and effective.
Reworked Post 5 :
In the world of ever-changing & evolving marketing strategies, the 4Ps - product, price, place, and promotion - stand as fundamental pillars.
Applying them effectively requires a deep understanding of consumer behaviour and market dynamics.
The Earth Collective adheres to the 4Ps, ensuring our products, pricing, distribution, and marketing align with our sustainable ethos.
Here are some of the ways we have accounted for the 4Ps at The Earth Collective:
>>Product:
We have created products that target specific hair concerns, using only the highest quality ingredients and packaging.
For instance, our Water Defence Spray is a perfect solution as a product to the hair woes for all those who face the issue of hard water all the time! And on products that Indian hair truly needs.
>>Price:
We have carefully priced our products, including combos, regimes & travel-sized minis to make them as affordable as possible.
We recently introduced Travel & Trial Packs for all those who did not want to commit to a full-size product without knowing its true value, and a many times price is what held them back. These packs are competitively priced and a great way to try a new product in a pocket-friendly way, quite literally
>>Place:
Well, online is the place to be for us! And we have partnered with E-commerce players like Nykaa, Amazon, FlipKart, Tata Cliq along with come boutique-ish platforms like Vanity Wagon and Sublime Life
But we understand that from time to time people do like a look and feel of the product and so you might just catch us at beauty and lifestyle exhibitions as well.
Promotion:
Along with being active on social media platforms like Instagram, we leverage marketing strategies like influencer marketing, PR, email marketing, etc. We also make it a point to adopt channels like WhatsApp marketing that show a lot of promise.
We are a growing community with 34K+ followers on Facebook and 13.5K+ followers on Instagram, along with a sizable presence on other platforms like YouTube.
Topic 6: How online marketplaces like Nykaa or the recently launched Tira help in expanding businesses?
Pls change this topic to something else.
Agenda: To share your experience with such platforms - good or not so good. If you can provide 2-3 lines on this, it would be helpful.
Suggested visual: Your candid picture while working.
New topic:
Topic 6: What sustainable practices can be adopted in the haircare industry?
Pls change the topic as it would not be as fruitful for us. When it comes to being eco-friendly, people expect a lot from packaging which we are not providing with at the moment. Hence lets explore something else.
Agenda: To explore sustainable strategies and eco-friendly initiatives that can be adopted by the haircare industry to reduce its environmental footprint.
Suggested visual: Your candid picture while working.
New Topic 6: How people can have customized products for pre-wash, wash, and post-wash with The Earth Collective?
Agenda: To highlight the feature of routine builder by The Earth Collective and how it helps people select the right product basis their hair type and concern. We can give this routine builder quiz link in the comments as well.
Suggested visual: Any picture of the pre-wash, wash, and post-wash products.
Raise your hand if you have ever felt like you are using the wrong haircare products.
I used to come across many women who complained about their hair concerns;
Upon enquiry, I found out they were using completely incorrect haircare products and not the ones suited to their hair type.
I knew I wanted to bridge this gap.
To address this, we launched a Routine Builder at The Earth Collective.
This handy tool takes the guesswork out of haircare by asking you a few simple questions about your hair type, concerns, and desired results.
With our routine builder, you can have customized pre-wash, wash, and post-wash routines with product recommendations that are perfect for your hair.
Would love to know what you think about it (the link is in the comments)

About me
Currently I lead The Earth Collective - a premium hair products brand. I started TEC in 2020 and it’s been (and continues to be) quite the journey.
When TEC  started, I knew I wanted to build a brand that stood out from the crowd. We did this by combining science and natural ingredients, hence becoming ‘The Hair Specialist’. I know that every individual’s hair and scalp needs are different, and that’s exactly what we wanted to communicate through TEC. To ensure best quality products and complete control over QC, we also started our own manufacturing unit.
I always had a passion for entrepreneurship but it deepened after my marriage. My Husband and Father-in-law had immense experience within the cosmetic industry, which is where I gained from their profound knowledge and credit a lot of what the Earth Collective is to their unconditional support.
New Content  (Option 2 - Tone of Voice - Smart Casual and different last paragraph) We will go ahead with this option
Currently, I'm at the helm of  The Earth Collective - a premium hair products brand, a journey that commenced in 2020 and has been nothing short of remarkable.
When I kickstarted TEC, my vision was crystal clear - to build a brand that would stand out amidst the crowd. Our distinctive edge came from seamlessly blending scientific expertise with the goodness of natural ingredients, thus establishing ourselves as 'The Haircare Specialists'.
Recognizing that each individual's hair and scalp have unique demands, our aim was to echo this diversity through the essence of TEC. To ensure the finest quality products and exert complete control over quality checks, we manufacture our entire range of products in-house at our own facility, based out of Kolkata, with over 4 decades of experience.

Post 2: Hair care industry growth
Agenda: Overall we can look at a 5 year trend or so and look at global growth and even growth in the indian market.
Suggested Visual: This will be text-based post
Post Description:
The Hair Care Market is expected to double in value to USD 172.6 Billion by 2032, at a CAGR of 6.8%!
Here are some key industry trends and insights that we have been looking out for:
Hair colouring products make up 1/5th of the global hair care market. The desire for self-expression, covering greying hair, and exploring different looks has fueled the demand for a diverse range of hair colouring options.
The men's hair & personal care market is projected to hit $276.9 billion by 2030. This surge can be attributed to changing perceptions of masculinity, increased grooming awareness, and a broader acceptance of self-care among men.
40.2% of consumers say they look for natural ingredients when making a purchase decision. Brands that prioritise transparency and source high-quality, natural ingredients are likely to resonate more strongly with consumers
Consumers who get personalised recommendations are 75% more likely to make a purchase. By leveraging customer data and preferences, brands should look to deliver recommendations that resonate with individual needs and desires.
These insights underscore the need for brands to adapt, innovate, and engage with consumers in meaningful ways. Understanding and capitalising on these trends can position brands for success in a competitive and rapidly changing market landscape.
Post 3: Insights about the industry
Agenda: This post will talk about the current reality of private label products in the hair care industry.
Suggested Visual: This will be a text-based post
Post Description:
Did you know?
Up to 70% of the hair care products in the Indian market are Private Labelled!
This means that a large number of hair care brands do not manufacture their own products, and rely on third-party white label manufacturers.
Due to this, these brands face several challenges:
They have limited access to powerful natural ingredients
They have no inputs on Quality Control
There is a lack of transparency
There is no room for scientific innovation & research
At The Earth Collective, we are well aware of the amount of work that goes into manufacturing your products directly, since our entire range is manufactured in-house to ensure standardisation, consistent product quality & transparency. This gives us a chance to innovate and produce every batch of products with a great deal of confidence.
Post 4: Educational (Industry) - Acceptance of ‘actives’ in the personal care industry
Agenda: We can look at this like a myth buster where a few years back using any acid was seen as a scary thing. And now actives like salicylic acid, glycolic acid and others are being accepted so well in the skin care industry. And also look at how it is seeping into the scalp and hair care industry
Suggested Visual: Single frame post highlighting key points
Creative Copy:
Myth: All actives are harsh chemicals with a lot of side-effects
Fact: Not all actives are harsh chemicals; many are derived from natural sources!
Myth: Actives are not suitable for sensitive skin & scalps
Fact: Sensitive skin can benefit from active ingredients when selected carefully and used in properly formulated products
Myth: Actives can’t be combined with other potent ingredients
Fact: Most active ingredients can be combined effectively, but careful consideration of compatibility and potential for irritation is essential
Post Description:
The rise of actives in hair care
Just a few short years ago, seeing an ‘acid (active)’ in the ingredients list would have deterred most consumers. However, consumer education has shattered myths & misconceptions, leading to increased demand for safe & effective ‘actives’ like Salicylic Acid, Glycolic Acid, etc. in skin & scalp care.
From skin care to hair care, these ingredients have found their way to mainstream acceptance.
Post 5: Product Focused - Leave-in-treatments
Agenda: This will focus on the product line and talk about how these are effective and convenient to use. Their importance and acceptance has increased over time, especially in scalp care.
Why are Leave-in Treatments all the rage these days?
....And Do They Really Work?
How do Leave-in Treatments work?
Leave-in treatments are formulated to address specific concerns
They are applied directly to the hair or skin without the need for rinsing
They are designed to be left on the hair or scalp for an extended period, allowing the active ingredients to penetrate & work gradually
Why we believe in Leave-In Treatments
Several studies have highlighted the effectiveness of leave-in conditioners in providing and maintaining hydration in the hair
Some studies have investigated the use of leave-in treatments with protein-based ingredients for strengthening & repairing damaged hair
Studies have explored the anti-frizz properties of leave-in treatments, particularly those containing ingredients like natural oils
At The Earth Collective, Leave-in Treatments have become one of our most popular categories of products. They are also our ‘most reordered’ product category.
Do you use Leave-in Treatments in your hair care routine? Let us know!
Post 6: Hair Care v/s Hair Cure
Agenda: This post looks to educate the audience on the difference between ‘Hair Care’ & ‘Hair Cure’, and why both aspects are essential for healthy, nourished hair.
Suggested Visual: This can be a single creative comparing Hair Care & Hair Cure with bold headings & minimal content on the creative.
Creative Copy:
Hair Cure - Because specific problems need targeted solutions
>  ‘Hair Cure’ emphasises recommending the right products & routine to address specific concerns through specialised formulations.
Hair Care - Because prevention is the best cure!
> ‘Hair Care’ emphasises using the right ingredients, free of harmful chemicals, to ensure that the scalp & hair are properly nourished & well maintained.
Post Description:
Understand our holistic approach to hair care. Our range is carefully curated to provide the right care and cure to your scalp & hair!
Holistic hair care isn't a luxury; it's a right that everyone deserves. At The Earth Collective, we're making this vision accessible by offering premium formulations at affordable prices.
We believe that true hair care is a combination of nurturing and healing – a philosophy that drives every formulation we create.

Post 1: Hair Care Industry Trends: Personalised Hair Care
Agenda: This post will look to highlight the hair care industry trend of shifting towards personalised hair care, based on each individual’s unique hair type & concerns.
Suggested Visual: Text-based post
Post Description:
One size Doesn’t fit all…
In recent years, the hair care industry has woken up to the fact that each person, at different points in time, has unique hair & scalp conditions that require personalised Cure & Care!
The Indian hair care industry is also embracing this 'Hair Care Personalisation' revolution. Brands are now tailoring products to cater to specific hair types and concerns. Here's why it's a game-changer:
From straight and silky to curly and frizzy, brands are offering personalised solutions for every hair type, ensuring the right care for individual needs.
Ingredients like hibiscus for shine, coconut oil for moisture, and aloe vera for scalp health are being incorporated to address unique concerns.
Some brands even use digital tools to analyse hair and scalp conditions, recommending products that truly match your needs.
Many brands are aligning personalisation with sustainability, reducing waste by providing only what your hair requires.
As the industry evolves, so does our ability to achieve our #HairGoals!

Suggested Visual: Text-based post
Post Description:
Have you been ignoring Scalp Care?

Post 2: Industry Trends
Agenda: Industry trends - the rise of long & coloured hair among men (caution - product buildup, harmful chemicals)
Suggested Visual: Text-based Post
Post Description:
In recent years, the world of men's hairstyling has witnessed a remarkable shift as long and coloured hair has become increasingly popular.
Men are now embracing diverse styles that include longer locks and a variety of hair colours.
While this trend reflects evolving perceptions of masculinity and self-expression, there are important considerations, primarily revolving around product buildup and the use of potentially harmful chemicals.
Product Buildup:
The use of styling products, such as gels, waxes, and hair sprays, can lead to product buildup in long hair. Regular cleansing and conditioning are crucial to maintain healthy hair and prevent issues like dandruff.
Chemical Exposure:
Many hair dyes and bleaches contain chemicals that can damage the hair and scalp. To avoid adverse effects, it's important to choose high-quality, gentle products and seek professional advice when considering a new colour.
As the trend of long and coloured hair among men continues to gain momentum, it's essential to balance self-expression with responsible hair care.

Post Description:
When we are asked what our approach to hair care is, the easiest way to answer that question is to point to our products.
At The Earth Collective, our approach always begins with understanding the lifestyle & concern-based hair care needs of our customers. For example, here are a couple of our most popular lifestyle regimes:
Swimmers Hair Care Duo:
For those who love the water, our Swimmers Hair Care Duo is a game-changer. Chlorine and saltwater can be harsh on your locks, but our formula is designed to gently cleanse and replenish, leaving your hair feeling fresh and vibrant.
Workout Hair Care Duo -  Quick Wash & Post-Wash:
We get it; you're dedicated to your fitness journey. But you don’t have to let a sweaty, greasy scalp & limp hair come in the way of your next workout! Our Workout Hair Care Duo is all about managing that post-workout hair, cleansing it gently & keeping it moisturised throughout the day.
These regimes offer a deep insight into our approach to hair care. We believe in creating products that effortlessly integrate into your lifestyle, ensuring that your hair & scalp always look and feel their best.
Your hair should reflect your active and vibrant life, not be a victim of it.

Post 6:TEC Loot
Agenda: This is an engaging post discussing the ‘TEC Loot’
Suggested Visual: Text-based Post
Post Description:
We recently got ‘looted’ (True Story!)
.
.
.
.
It was a regular September morning at the office when suddenly, our order notification alerts started going off - incessantly!
We were being flooded with seemingly genuine orders - with real names & addresses. But somehow, it seemed too good to be true.
And sure enough, when we took a closer look - all the order values were in single digits, and included several products each.
After several hours of professional panicking, our tech team finally figured out the problem. It was a bug on our website that was being exploited. Specifically, it was pertaining to a plug-in software we were using for our Loyalty Program.
Our tech team immediately got to work, running detailed diagnostics & fixing any other loopholes and bugs.
What amazed us was the speed at which this spread across a network of social media platforms. We had no idea there were dedicated channels, and a community of engaged users.
(There’s even a YouTube video of it - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kabcFIwep8o&t=180s)
After all the dust has settled down, we definitely loved all the attention we got. If nothing else, it was at least good for branding, right?

This prevents the typical shedding of hair. You may notice that your hair is lush and thick during this time.After childbirth, estrogen levels drop. This causes a large number of hairs to enter the resting phase of hair growth. After a few months, this hair starts to shed.How will this regime help me?The Hair Density Tonic in this regime helps treat hormonal hair loss and even helps promote healthy hair growth.

An Inspirational Journey to Self Confidence - The Tyra Banks Story!
What I learned from interviewing Tyra Banks
Hey SPKR Fam! Thanks for registering your interest in SPKR by Nimi Mehta. We’re thrilled to have you on-board; and we’ll be releasing info on the official online course very soon!
They say you shouldn’t meet your heroes, but Tyra was everything I thought she’d be and more!
I watched Tyra as a TV Host on her own hit show ‘The Tyra Banks Show’ when I was a teenager, and looked up to her immensely. And when I got the opportunity to sit down with Tyra Banks and interview her, the little Nimi inside me was screaming in disbelief.
I may well be biassed, but I noticed some delightful character traits during our interview
- She instantly complimented me and my outfit. I could see that she genuinely loved to uplift others.
- She took time to answer all my questions patiently & shared personal stories in detail.
- She treats everyone with respect. I saw this playing out when she warmly greeted my team.
- Her body language was present, poised & yet approachable.
After the interview was over Tyra took time to praise me for my interviewing skills. Needless to say, I was over the moon!
Tyra Banks is a woman who epitomises confidence, resilience, and empowerment. From her early struggles to her meteoric rise, Tyra's story is a testament to the power of self-belief and determination.
“ I have a big forehead, and I got made fun of all the time. When I was a little girl, they used to call me 'five-head'. ”
Tyra Banks, born on December 4, 1973, faced challenges that shaped her path towards becoming a confident role model. Growing up, she encountered criticism and doubt about her appearance, which fueled her ambition to redefine beauty standards. Despite these early struggles, Tyra channelled her determination and embarked on a transformative journey.
“ 'America's Next Top Model' is not a bunch of Barbies - it's a lot of girls that are atypically beautiful.”
Tyra's commitment to empowering others led her to create the groundbreaking reality show ""America's Next Top Model."" Through the show, she aimed to offer aspiring models a chance to break into the industry regardless of their background or appearance. Tyra's vision provided a platform for many to embrace their uniqueness.

Hey SPKR Fam! Thanks for registering your interest in SPKR by Nimi Mehta. We’re thrilled to have you on-board; and we’ll be releasing info on the official online course very soon!
From the time they are born, children soak up everything like little sponges. Their learned behaviour is strongly modelled after - not what their parents tell them, but what their parents do & how they carry themselves.
Your communication style today lays the groundwork for your child’s future self-assurance
Inner Voice Becomes Outer Voice
The way you talk to your kids becomes their inner voice. If you constantly belittle or criticise them, they may grow up with self-doubt and insecurities. On the other hand, nurturing, encouraging words will become the foundation for their self-worth and confidence.
Building Resilience
Effective communication in parenting is crucial in helping children develop resilience. By discussing their challenges and offering support, you teach them that it's okay to stumble and that they have the strength to bounce back.
Developing Emotional Intelligence
When you communicate effectively with your kids, you help them identify and express their emotions. This emotional intelligence is a valuable skill that tells them how to build confidence to navigate life's ups and downs.
How to Build Confidence in Your Child
Be an Attentive Listener: When your child speaks, give them your full attention, maintain eye contact, and acknowledge their feelings.
Encourage Openness: Avoid judgments and criticism, and instead, offer constructive feedback.
Use Positive Reinforcement: Praise their efforts and accomplishments sincerely to boost their self-belief.
Encourage Independence: Offer opportunities for your child to make decisions and solve problems on their own.

Why A Commanding Presence Matters
Become a persuasive communicator & negotiator
Communicate impactfully to leave a lasting impression
Cultivate a strong presence to stand out in professional settings

Cultivating A Strong Presence - Professionally & Personally

Develop a confident voice by speaking clearly and at a moderate pace. Practice varying your pitch and tone to avoid sounding monotone.
Actively listen, by demonstrating genuine interest in what others are saying. Respond thoughtfully to show you value their input.
Be genuine and authentic to yourself in all interactions to build trust. Share your thoughts & ideas openly, and admit when you don't know something.

Subject Line: Mastering ‘Diction’ can transform your communication!
Hey SPKR!
Thanks for registering your interest in SPKR by Nimi Mehta. We’re so happy to have you as a part of our community.
Diction is the art of pronouncing words clearly & distinctly. Here’s why it’s essential in public speaking.
The Power of Enunciation
Pay close attention to the pronunciation of each syllable and word. Practise mindful speaking to ensure that your enunciation remains consistently clear.
Pauses: Pacing Your Speech
Combine pauses with deliberate articulation to ensure each word is given the attention it deserves. Experiment with the pace of your speech, using slower sections for emphasis.
Active Listening
Active listening allows you to attune your ears to the subtle nuances of language. Actively engage with diverse accents, tones, and speech styles of those around you.
Feedback & Recording Yourself
Along with watching recordings of yourself, constructive criticism can directly pinpoint areas for improvement like pronunciation, articulation, and overall clarity.
Quick & Effective Vocal Exercise: Tongue Twisters
Choose a tongue twister or create your own. For example: ""She sells seashells by the seashore.""
Begin by saying the tongue twister slowly and clearly, paying attention to each syllable and sound.
Gradually increase the speed while maintaining clarity. Challenge yourself to articulate each word precisely, even as you speed up.

Subject Line: My time at Paus Cafe & Community, Dubai with Sophiya
Hey SPKR!
Thanks for registering your interest in SPKR by Nimi Mehta. We’re so happy to have you as a part of our community.
I got to be the first guest at Paus Cafe + Community, Dubai, a safe space in the heart of the city, where people can focus on their well-being & carve meaning in their lives.
I sat down with the Founder Sophiya, where we explored various topics and themes that we encounter in our everyday lives. Although I was there to share my insights as a guest, I learned so much myself…
Here were my key takeaways from our free-flowing conversation
Love & Respect
- We're all the same. When you take away all the noise & expectations that society puts on us, we all want and need the same things.
Staying Present
- A lot of us don't feel present in our lives, and things like social media and the virtual world disconnects us from our real life relationships. We need to implement habits to reduce our screen time in order to be more present.
Communicating Your Talent
- The world is full of so many talented individuals, the challenge for most is knowing how to communicate that message across to others. It starts with how we perceive ourselves - once we change that mindset, doors will open.
Being Nice is Cool
- We're in a world where 'being a diva' or 'being a bit difficult' is supposed to get you respect in the workplace or in social circles. Instead, try being authentic and kind to every person you encounter. Beyond becoming successful, how do you want to be remembered?
I had a great time speaking with so many of you that are interested in the upcoming SPKR course. I loved hearing what YOU want in the course.

Finding Your Voice w/ Gary Vee
Hey SPKR Fam!
Thanks for registering your interest in SPKR by Nimi Mehta. We’re thrilled to have you on-board; and we’ll be releasing info on the official online course very soon…
I recently had the pleasure of chatting with Gary Vee! Gary opens up about how he came to find his voice, and the importance of communication.
Gary Vaynerchuk is a serial entrepreneur, motivational speaker and author. He is one of the most sought after public speakers alive today, with a massive presence across social media platforms.
“All I’m really trying to do for the world is what my mom did for me”
Here’s a snippet from our conversation!
“You spoke on stage about how communication is probably the greatest thing you can master. How did you know how to use your voice?”
“I knew how to use it because all I’m really trying to do for the world is what my mom did for me, which is to create a level of accountable (& practical) optimism, joy & love - but not at the expense of merit. So it was easy to figure out what I wanted to do with my voice.”
People discover the power of their voice at different stages of their life, career & journey. It’s a process which requires conscious intention & work. And who better to hear this from, than Gary Vee himself?!

Hey SPKR Fam! Thanks for registering your interest in SPKR by Nimi Mehta. We’re thrilled to have you on-board; and we’ll be releasing info on the official online course very soon!
Gender Differences in Public Speaking
When it comes to public speaking, gender can influence the way individuals approach and experience the process. Let’s explore some key differences!
Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus…
Men tend to emphasise logical reasoning, assertiveness, and a direct approach. On the other hand, women may focus more on storytelling, emotional connection, and empathy.
“I don’t need to read the instructions”  -  Men
Men often report higher levels of confidence in public speaking compared to women. This difference may stem from societal expectations and gender biases. However, it's essential to note that confidence is not limited to any specific gender.
The reality of Perception & Bias
Women may encounter stereotypes that they are less competent or authoritative as speakers. On the other hand, men may face expectations to display a certain level of dominance or assertiveness.
We all get a little nervous sometimes
While nervousness is a common experience for speakers of all genders, women may experience higher levels of anxiety and self-doubt before speaking in public.
Embrace Your Authenticity!
Whether you identify as male, female, or non-binary, speaking from the heart allows you to create a genuine connection. Let go of any preconceived notions about how you should present yourself based on gender. Embrace your uniqueness and let it shine through in your public speaking!
Check out our recent blog post to learn more about the differences in public speaking for
men & women.

Hey SPKR Fam! Thanks for registering your interest in SPKR by Nimi Mehta. We’re thrilled to have you on-board; and we’ll be releasing info on the official online course very soon!
Whether you're a seasoned pro or just starting out, dealing with anxiety is a common challenge in public speaking. Today, we’ll explore the root causes of this anxiety and share some valuable tips.
Understanding Public Speaking Anxiety
Fear of judgement & rejection
Perfectionism
Lack of confidence
Past negative experiences
Overthinking & excessive self-criticism
Managing Public Speaking Anxiety
> Rehearse in front of a mirror, record yourself, or practise with a friend. The more you practise, the more comfortable you'll become.
> Taking deep, slow breaths can help calm your nerves. Try inhaling for a count of four, holding for four, and exhaling for four.
> Imagine yourself delivering a successful presentation. Visualising a positive outcome can reduce anxiety.
> Replace negative thoughts with positive affirmations. Remind yourself of your strengths and capabilities.
> Remember that it's okay to make mistakes. No one is perfect, and the audience is usually more forgiving than you think.

The secrets of time management from a public speaking coach
Tick-tock, tick-tock! Time flies when you're on stage…
HEY SPKR FAM!
If you’ve ever run up against the clock during a speaking engagement, you’ll know how hard it can be to manage time while also trying to deliver an effective speech. In the world of public speaking, understanding that time is your most valuable asset is the first step to mastering it.
Structure Your Speech
I’ve observed that breaking down your speech into key sections: introduction, body, and conclusion works wonders. Allocate a specific amount of time for each section, ensuring you don't get lost in the labyrinth of your own words.
Practice Makes Punctual
Rehearsing your speech helps you gauge how long it takes to deliver each segment, allowing you to fine-tune and adjust your timing accordingly.
Create a Clear Outline
Outline your main ideas and subpoints concisely, enabling you to navigate through your speech smoothly. Use bullet points to keep your speech on track and stay within the time limits.
To learn more about time management in public speaking, check out my recent blog post on the SPKR website!

Hey SPKR Fam! Thanks for registering your interest in SPKR by Nimi Mehta. We’re thrilled to have you on-board; and we’ll be releasing info on the official online course very soon!
I noticed how important habits were when I grew up seeing my Dad with his militant morning routine & my Mum with her unfailing daily religious customs.
And when I read Atomic Habits, the incredible power of habits and their potential to affect change blew me away. Here are some key takeaways that I just HAD to share with you.
Set Clear Goals: Define your objectives and what you want to achieve with your new habit. Having a specific goal in mind provides motivation and direction.
Start Small: Begin with manageable tasks or mini-habits that are easy to incorporate into your daily routine. This reduces the initial resistance to change.
Be Consistent: Consistency is key to habit formation. Aim to practise your habit at the same time and in the same context each day, making it a part of your routine.
Use Triggers: Associate your habit with an existing habit or a specific cue. For example, if you want to develop a reading habit, read a few pages right after having your morning coffee.
Track Progress: Keep a journal or use habit-tracking apps to monitor your progress. This helps you stay accountable and provides a sense of accomplishment.
Stay Patient: Habits take time to develop, and setbacks are normal. Don't get discouraged by occasional lapses; focus on getting back on track.
Reward Yourself: Celebrate your achievements, even the small ones. Positive reinforcement can motivate you to continue your habit-building journey.
Seek Support: Share your goals with friends or join a community with similar interests. Having a support system can provide encouragement and accountability.
Learn from Failure: Analyse why you might have slipped up and use those insights to make adjustments and improve your approach.
Adapt & Evolve: As you progress, your goals and habits may change. Be open to adapting your habits to align with your evolving needs and aspirations.

Hey SPKR Fam! Thanks for registering your interest in SPKR by Nimi Mehta. We’re thrilled to have you on-board; and we’ll be releasing info on the official online course very soon!
Being on LIVE TV is not for the faint hearted! It’s a fast paced, ever-changing environment that requires your constant attention.
For those of you who don’t know, I host a daily LIVE TV show across the UAE. Although you see the finished product, there’s lots more than meets the eye. Here’s what it takes to go LIVE on National TV.
1. Scripts
Scripts are sent to me 48 hours before the show. This allows me to understand the theme of the episode, the context, the guests and to make my own notes. A lot of the scripts are “Ad-Lib” meaning to improvise lines or a speech on the spot.
2. Emotions
No matter what my mood is; stressed, unhappy, tired or irritable – I have to keep it in check. The TV environment is based on energy, which requires every person from the camera crew to the production gallery & makeup artists to be positive & on top of their game.
3. Image
Looking my best is essential to feeling my best. Hair, makeup and styling begin 2 hours before the studio ‘call-time’. This gives us sufficient time to get ready and perfect it all; each presenter has their own unique look that is celebrated.
4. Guests
Guests are a very important part of the show. They shape our content, give their expertise and provide value for all. I ensure I personally meet every guest coming on the show & go over the talking points before going live, to (hopefully) make them feel at ease.
5. Sound Checks
We have two wires always connected to us during the show. The first is our microphone, the second is our earpiece. The earpiece is the only form of communication my producers have with me whilst we’re shooting, and is vital to keep the show on track.
As tedious as it all can sometimes feel, I wouldn’t give it up for the world! The incredible guests I get to meet, and my amazing colleagues & crew make every day in this profession incredibly rewarding.

Hey SPKR Fam!
Thanks for registering your interest in SPKR by Nimi Mehta. We’re so happy to have you as a part of our community.
Public speaking is an art form that allows us to communicate with impact. But have you ever wondered how some speakers seem to effortlessly captivate their audience?
Embrace the Power of Persona
Channel Your Inner Superhero: Just like Clark Kent becomes Superman, your alter ego can transform you into a confident, charismatic speaker.
Character Traits: Define the qualities you want your alter ego to possess. Is it the wit of a stand-up comedian or the gravitas of a seasoned professor?
Develop your Stage Presence
Body Language: Your alter ego's body language is crucial. Practise confident posture, gestures, and movements that reflect your chosen persona.
Voice Control: Adjust your tone, pitch, and pacing to match your alter ego's characteristics. A deep, authoritative voice or a playful, animated one can enhance your performance.
Craft Your Speech
Storytelling: Weave stories and anecdotes that align with your alter ego's persona. Your audience will connect with your message on a deeper level when it's delivered in a compelling narrative.
Language & Vocabulary: Tailor your language to match your character. A corporate executive might use formal language, while a motivational speaker may employ more informal, relatable terms.
Keep Evolving!
Your alter ego can evolve over time. Experiment with different personas to match diverse speaking situations & audiences, and Discover Your Voice!

Highlights: Host of Jay Shetty’s Love Rules World Tour
Hey SPKR!
Thanks for registering your interest in SPKR by Nimi Mehta. We’re thrilled to have you on-board; and we’ll be releasing info on the official online course very soon…
When Jay Shetty calls, you answer!
Jay Shetty is a British podcaster, author, and life coach. His captivating videos have amassed a staggering 10 billion views, and he boasts a massive following of over 50 million people across various social media platforms. Jay started ‘On Purpose’ in 2019, which has now become the world's leading Health and Wellness podcast.
Jay Shetty ‘Love Rules’ World Tour
Jay is a dear friend of mine, and when he asked me to host the stage for his World Tour; it was the quickest “YES!” I’ve ever given.
5 World Tour Dates – 4 Different Cities – Tens of Thousands of People!
> Mumbai
> Hyderabad
> Bangalore
> Dubai
The excitement was there, of course, but before I knew it, Imposter syndrome kicked in – “Can I really do this?”
Then after talking to my support system around me for reassurance, one quote kept playing in my mind “You’re exactly where you’re meant to be”.
And so there I was, night after night, show after show; rising to the occasion. I took to the stage, hyped up the crowd, had great conversations with Jay on stage, and walked off proud. Proud of the younger version of myself, who didn’t have the confidence to ask a waiter for a glass of water; but is now hosting the stage for one of the biggest names in the world.
It was unbelievable to see Jay in his element. I learned so much from him as a Public Speaker; and I’d like to share them with you:
> The way he pauses at pivotal moments in his sentence, to grab the audience attention
> The way he uses humour to bring people back into the room
> The visual elements he utilised on screen to evoke emotion
My #1 Takeaway: You never stop learning. You can always improve; you can always be better. Surrounding yourself with those more experienced than you is essential to your own growth. It won’t only inspire you but it will remind you to never settle for less.
This was a week I’ll never forget, and a time I’ll always look back on with so much gratitude.
Now, I’m just waiting for Harry Styles to ask me on tour with him, and my life will be complete 🙃

Highlights from my Public Speaking Workshop in Abu Dhabi!
Hey SPKR!
Thanks for registering your interest in SPKR by Nimi Mehta. We’re thrilled to have you on-board; and we’ll be releasing info on the official online course very soon!
In the meantime, I wanted to share how I recently partnered with Cloud Spaces, a co-working space in the UAE, to give a workshop on Public Speaking in Abu Dhabi. It was a fun, engaged session, and I had a great time conducting it!
The workshop was organised & announced only a week in advance, and I wasn’t sure if the turnout would be great. But low and behold – all the seats were full!
Who Was The Workshop For?
The workshop was open to all individuals across industries & walks of life. People from all over Dubai drove up to the Capital to attend the workshop. The attendees included:
> Members from the Zomato UAE team.
> A Government Official who is addressing the HH Sheikh Hamdan next week, and wanted some pointers.
> A freelance executive PA looking to better her communication skills.
During the workshop, a lot of the attendees had these common questions.
“How should I close my talk?”
“What if it’s a virtual meeting?”
“How do I keep their attention?”
“If I cannot smile and be animated, as it’s a formal talk, what can I do?”
The message was clear – everyone wants to be a better communicator. Everyone wants to be heard. Everyone wants to build a connection with their audience. Regardless of age, background, culture or industry; becoming a stronger communicator will change everything for the better!
A big Thank You to all the incredible attendees, and Cloud Spaces for organising the workshop!

C:\Users\Admin\Downloads\drive_export\takeout-20250828T085433Z-1-001\Takeout\Drive\Unorganised\Instructions to the bot - beauty brief.docx,"About KindHub:
Brief: https://www.kindhub.com/ KindHub is an online platform designed to simplify sustainable and ethical living by providing a clear and quantifiable method for evaluating brands and products and categorizing them into KindHub’s own value system. Here is the value system that will stay rigid and the same for all evaluation:
(KindHub's value-based system)
1. Kind to Self (Physical and mental wellbeing)
Category: Product Safety and Wellness
Ingredient Safety: Evaluates the safety and non-toxicity of product ingredients to ensure no harmful chemicals are used.
Effectiveness: How well the product works as intended (e.g., skincare benefits, cosmetic performance, or personal care).
Mental Wellbeing: How the product contributes to mental and emotional well-being through self-care rituals or stress-relief features, like soothing ingredients or calming effects.
2. Kind to the Earth (Resource Intensiveness and Byproducts)
Category: Environmental Impact
Sustainable Sourcing and processing: Evaluates the use of sustainably sourced ingredients and materials in the products and packaging such as organic, renewable, or recycled resources.
Packaging: Assesses the recyclability, biodegradability, and minimalism of product packaging to minimize environmental footprint and reduce waste.
Carbon Footprint and water usage: Evaluated tracking of the total carbon emissions associated with the product’s production, distribution, and usage. Measures the amount of water used in the production and lifecycle of the product, focusing on water-efficient processes, and attempts at mitigation and offset.
Waste Management: Evaluates the brand’s policies on reducing waste, including initiatives such as recycling programs or refill options for products.
3. Kind to Lives (Animal Welfare and Cruelty-Free Practices)
Category: Ethical Treatment of Animals
Cruelty-Free: Ensures that the product is not tested on animals, following cruelty-free certifications such as Leaping Bunny or PETA.
Animal-free: Measures whether the product contains any animal-derived ingredients or by-products.
Category: Ethical Impact
Fair Labor Practices: Ensures that workers involved in the production process are treated fairly, paid a living wage, and work in safe conditions.
Humanitarian Initiatives: Evaluates the brand’s involvement in charitable activities or initiatives that benefit underprivileged communities.
Community Support: Assesses how the brand supports local communities or indigenous groups, including ensuring ethical supply chain practices and giving back to the community.
What we will use ChatGPT bot for:
We are going to be evaluating beauty, fashion, food, stationery, etc. For now we have nailed down a template to evaluate Beauty brands ONLY. I will give templates for other categories later.
Bot expectation:
The end user of the Chatbot (KindHub) will only add the brand URL in the chatbot. No other conversations must be had or encouraged. Only response should be the templatized table evaluation response. NOTHING ELSE.
1. Beauty Brands evaluation:
All beauty brands must and only should be evaluated based on this below given template. you must scour the internet on at least 5-10 websites or more to check and verify all information and mention the same in notes column along with the links(MUST BE CLICKABLE) of where the information was taken from, no rows of any criteria can be empty, since the information needs to be validated and should allow users to verify the given point and understand the rationale behind the points given for all criteria. The table will have a display of the total point given for the category(to show attained score/out of total assigned for category) and the attained point for each criteria(to show attained point/total point for the criteria) by the brand that the end user puts to evaluate. Here is the final template for the beauty brand where everything has to be checked and graded as per instructions:
for all points where yes or no is mentioned, yes gets the mentioned point, no gets 0. If there is a false claim where they have mentioned they have a certificate or if they have claimed to be ""eco-friendly"" or any such point and the certificate or claim is not verifiable then that criteria is penalised wherever the penalty exists.
Total points gained out of 100 must be displayed.
Gaining 100/100 is very tough with all the criteria given. where penalties do not exist or if it's a binary answer of a Yes/No question then the points are straightforward given points, 0, or penalised points. if it says tiered for criteria where the answers are not binary, full marks for a partial answer cannot be given (ex: 50% recycled packaging material cannot get 10/10. it should be like 5/10 because it's not a full blown effort by the company)
Points should not be very lenient, ALL criteria must be verified thoroughly and ONLY given. total point of each criteria and the allotted point for the given point as a rating should be visible.
Don'ts: Do not get into anything remotely related to health and anything that requires diet or health certifications. DO NOT respond a generic paragraph about the brand like the normal GPT answers. ONLY TABLE EVALUATION RESPONSE.
Conclusion:
After providing table format and scoring for a brand you must give a summary in these three points:
Brand’s strength
Brands’s areas of improvement
What ""value"" based on KindHubs value based system (given on top - Kind to Self, Kind to Earth and Kind to Others ONLY and no other value to be made up) the brand falls under and why in a brief sentence. If none of the three values apply, can say that the brand is not KindHub qualified and they should focus on being more kinder one way or the other
1. Point Assignment Rules:
Yes/No Criteria (Binary):
Yes = Full points for the criterion.
No = 0 points for the criterion.
False Claims = Apply penalties based on the established rules (e.g., eco-friendly or cruelty-free claims without verifiable certification).
Tiered Criteria (Non-Binary):
Assign points proportionally based on partial achievement.
Example: If a brand uses 50% recycled materials, award 50% of the total points for that criterion.
2. Penalties:
False or Misleading Claims:
If the brand makes claims (e.g., organic, cruelty-free, eco-friendly) without proper certification, subtract penalty points from the total.
Follow the penalty rules provided in the table for each category (Kind to Self, Kind to Earth, Kind to Lives).
Penalties are subtracted from the total points before final scoring.
3. Displaying Points and Results:
Transparency in Scoring:
Display the total points out of 100 in the final table.
Award points only if justified by proper verification of claims.
Avoid leniency; apply points strictly based on the evidence provided.
4. Do's and Don'ts:
Do:
Provide a detailed table format evaluation.
Thoroughly verify every claim made by the brand.
Ensure each criterion’s score is clearly visible in the table.
Don't:
Avoid discussing anything related to health, diet, or medical certifications.
Do not respond with generic brand descriptions or opinions. Only provide the table and objective evaluation.
5. Summary and Conclusion:
After providing the detailed table and points, conclude the evaluation by covering:
Brand’s Strengths:
Highlight where the brand performed well and earned points.
Brand’s Areas of Improvement:
Identify where the brand failed or could improve.

Hi Mohammed,
 
This exit tale isn’t just another story – it’s our 25th property exit, and boy, did it deliver!
With over 100% ROI, we couldn’t be more excited. Now, we know what you’re
thinking: ""25th Exit? Over 100% ROI?""  Yes, it’s a lot to take in, but we’ll happily walk
you through it in our latest Exit Tale which took place in Al Waha (Dubailand)!
📍 Al W aha Whereabouts:
Al Waha is a modern gated villa sub-community within Dubailand’ s many sub-
districts, built in a modern Mediterranean style. Essentially , it’s a residential project
offering idyllic villas that lie along Emirates Road (E61 1). Part of the Shorooq and Al
Layan developments, known for their well-developed, family-friendly environments,
this 1,824 sq ft unit was a spacious two-bedroom townhome with access to the
backyard.
🎯 Smart Strategy:
We saw the potential in Al Waha early on. The property was purchased for AED
765,000 by 84 investors in February 2021 during the COVID pandemic, when the
Dubai real estate market was recovering and demand for villas and townhomes was
on the rise. Moreover , being one of the largest two-bedrooms in all of Dubai with low
service charges, this unit stood out to renters and potential buyers, and it was
eventually sold for AED 1,650,000 in May 2024!Mohammed Herky <m.herky@gmail.com>

Waha was a strategic decision as the market was bouncing back, with villas

observed market trends, and then sold high at the perfect moment in May 2024,
maximizing returns for our investors.

huge profits, with investors doubling their money in just three years! Through

2nd Post: Investment Trends in Saudi (Hassan's personal opinion, not financial advice): Share insights on current investment trends in Saudi Arabia.

Post:
As someone who is deeply invested in Saudi Arabia's financial landscape, staying informed about investment trends is key. With its economy and ambitious Vision 2030 goals, the Kingdom offers fertile ground for investors.
One key trend I've observed is the diversification of the economy away from oil. Companies like ACWA Power represent opportunities emerging in sectors like technology, healthcare, and renewable energy.
Tech innovation is gaining momentum with various government initiatives and a young and tech-savvy population. Personally, I find startups like Sary and Tamara particularly intriguing. These ventures are reshaping the landscape with their innovative approaches.
Environmental, Social, and Governance concerns are becoming increasingly important and it is wonderful to see many startups take the lead in this space. You must check out Kijani and Edkary to see some of the work in this space!
As someone who keeps an eye on investment trends, it is interesting to see how the real estate industry has transformed after the pandemic.
The way in which regulatory reforms and consumer behavior are molding the fintech industry has increased the investment opportunities in robo-advisors and digital payments.
It's important to note that these are my personal observations and not financial advice. As with any investment decision, conducting thorough research and seeking professional guidance is recommended. Stay informed, stay prudent, and seize the opportunities that align with your investment goals.
3rd Post: What I Would Tell My 21-Year-Old Self (To Start Investing Early): Encourage early investment through a personal anecdote.
Suggested Visual: A picture from when you were a 21YO - at an eatery or university
Post:
Looking back on my journey from my early twenties, if there's one piece of advice I wish I could go back and share with my 21-year-old self: Start investing early.
When I was just starting out, full of ambition and ready to take on the world, the idea of investing felt overwhelming and daunting.
But looking back, I realize how starting early would have benefitted me. Over time, even the smallest contributions would have grown into something significant.
I’m not saying, the journey to financial independence is smooth sailing.
In fact, there have been many moments when market ups and downs made me question my decisions and worry about the future.
Investing isn't just about blindly trusting stocks or funds; it's about knowing the basics, doing your research, and setting achievable goals.
That's where financial literacy comes in. Educate yourself, ask questions, and don't hesitate to seek advice from experts along the way.
Taking the time to understand concepts like debt management, budgeting, and diversification helped me develop my strategy for financial planning.
It involves diversifying my portfolio across different asset classes, understanding the impact of market trends, and staying disciplined.
Listening to podcasts like ""The Investor's Journey"" and subscribing to newsletters like ""The Financial Frontier"" are good starting points to improve your financial knowledge.
They helped me understand the basics, research effectively, and set realistic goals.
What advice would you offer your younger self about finances?
4th Post: FinTech Trends in Saudi Arabia
Suggested Visual: Vision 2030 picture with skyline
From where I stand, Saudi Arabia isn't just about oil anymore.
People aren't likely to know this as we don't make headlines for our FinTech developments.
But the Kingdom’s FinTech industry is quietly gaining momentum and it's clear that this isn't just a passing trend.
So, let me share some key trends shaping the FinTech industry in Saudi Arabia.
Digital banks like STC Pay, Saudi Digital Bank, and D360 Bank offer personalized services such as customized budgeting tools, instant money transfers, and intuitive financial management dashboards, broadening financial access.
Open banking regulations allow third-party developers to create apps around financial institutions, fostering innovation and customer-centric services.​
The Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) and other bodies are offering significant government and regulatory support to promote FinTech through new frameworks and licenses​​.
The adoption of AI and machine learning have improved fraud detection by analyzing transaction patterns in real time, while also enhancing customer service and personalization of financial products.
I look forward to exciting developments in the financial sector, especially with Vision 2030's goal to position Saudi Arabia as a fintech hub, setting goals for 525 fintech companies and 18,000 jobs by 2030.
Staying informed on regulatory changes and engaging with government initiatives is crucial. For credible updates I follow sources like Arab News, FinTech Saudi, and SAMA's website.
I see this growth not only modernizing financial services but also contributing to economic diversification and enhancing citizens' quality of life. The momentum in fintech development sets the stage for me to envision Saudi Arabia leading financial innovation in the region."

Charter Plane Booking: A Complete Guide for Travelers
If you're looking to travel in style and privacy, then booking a charter plane might be the perfect option for you. Charter planes offer a range of benefits, including flexibility, convenience, and comfort. But navigating the world of charter plane booking can be overwhelming, especially if you're not familiar with the process.
That's why we've put together a complete guide to help you understand everything you need to know about charter plane booking.
What is a Charter Plane?
A charter plane is a private aircraft that is hired for exclusive use by an individual or group. Unlike commercial airlines, charter planes operate on flexible schedules, accommodating the specific needs and preferences of travellers. This adaptability ensures a personalised and efficient travel experience, free from the constraints of conventional air travel.
Fun Fact: According to a report from Forbes, six percent of the private jet flights around the globe are reserved exclusively for pets – along with their owners.
Benefits of Charter Plane Booking
Privacy: With a charter plane, you can travel without having to worry about crowded airports, long security lines, or sharing the cabin with other passengers.
Escape the crowds and enjoy unparalleled privacy while travelling. Whether for business or leisure, charter planes offer discretion ideal for high-profile individuals and people who need privacy in their travels.
Fun Fact: Aviation Factory's blog post reveals that middle managers, sales, marketing professionals, and staff account for more than 85% of business travel.
Flexibility: Charter planes can take off and land at a wide range of airports, including smaller regional airports that may not be served by commercial airlines. This flexibility allows you to avoid the hassle of taking connecting flights and long layovers.
Convenience: Charter planes offer a stress-free travel experience.They redefine convenience with tailored services and amenities designed to meet your every need, from personalised catering options to on-board amenities, everything is tailored to your needs and preferences.
Comfort: Charter planes provide a luxurious and comfortable flying experience. With spacious cabins, plush seating, and top-of-the-line amenities, you can relax and enjoy a smooth journey from start to finish.
How to Book a Charter Plane
Booking a charter plane may seem like a daunting task, but it doesn't have to be. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you navigate the process:
1. Determine Your Needs: Before you start searching for charter planes, think about your travel requirements. Consider factors such as the number of passengers, destination, travel dates, and any specific preferences you may have.
2. Research Charter Companies: Once you have a clear idea of what you're looking for, start researching charter companies that offer private plane services. Look for reputable companies with a track record of safety and reliability. Here are some websites you can use:
Air Charter Services
Private Fly
JetApp
3. Request Quotes: Contact several charter companies and request quotes for your trip. Be sure to provide detailed information about your travel needs so that they can provide an accurate price estimate.
4. Compare Options: Once you have received quotes from different charter companies, compare their services, pricing, and availability. Choose the option that best fits your budget and requirements.
5. Confirm Your Booking: After selecting a charter company, confirm your booking by signing a contract and making the necessary payment. Make sure to review the terms and conditions of the agreement to avoid any misunderstandings later on.
6. Catering Services: You may want to arrange catering services on board the plane, especially if you're travelling on a long-haul flight. Many charter companies offer a range of catering options, from simple snacks to gourmet meals. You can also request special dietary requirements if needed.
7. On-Ground Travel: It is important to book travel to and from the airport. Some charter companies offer ground transportation services, while others may be able to arrange for a rental car or taxi service. It's important to clarify these details with the charter company to avoid any last-minute surprises.
8. In-flight services: Finally, you may want to consider additional services such as in-flight entertainment, Wi-Fi, and other amenities. These services may come at an additional cost, but they can make your flight more comfortable and enjoyable. Be sure to discuss these options with the charter company and factor them into your budget.
9. Prepare for Security: When booking a charter plane, it's important to keep in mind that you'll still need to go through security checks. Be sure to bring your ID and any necessary travel documents, and arrive at the airport with plenty of time to spare.
10. Pack Wisely: Unlike commercial flights, charter planes typically have more flexible baggage policies. However, it's still important to pack wisely and avoid bringing any prohibited items on board. Check with your charter company to confirm their baggage policies and restrictions.
11. Customs and Immigration: When flying internationally on a charter plane, be sure to research the customs and immigration requirements for your destination. It's important to have all necessary documents and visas to avoid any delays or complications upon arrival. Your charter company should be able to provide guidance on these requirements.
If you are not sure what to do with selecting the right private aircraft, Continuum Aviation can help you with all your travel needs in a smooth way. We pride ourselves for exceptional service, safety, discretion, and customer satisfaction.
Tips for Charter Plane Booking
Plan Ahead: Charter planes are in high demand, especially during peak travel seasons. To secure the best aircraft and pricing, it's advisable to book your charter plane well in advance.
Jetsplore Aviation gives a good starting point for researching from official websites and social media accounts. Directly eliminate the companies that do not have an official website or have a very simple website that does not offer you anything.
Be Flexible: While charter planes offer flexibility, it's important to be open to adjusting your travel dates or itinerary if needed. This can help you take advantage of last-minute deals and availability.
Communicate Your Preferences: Don't be afraid to communicate your preferences and requirements with the charter company. They are there to help make your travel experience as seamless and enjoyable as possible.
It is important that you clarify everything before accepting the booking. Things like flying with changes, bringing a pet, or landing in a new country all have their own potential complications, so it’s necessary to be as thorough as possible.
Check Safety Standards: Before booking a charter plane, ensure that the company adheres to strict safety standards and regulations. This will give you peace of mind knowing that your journey is in safe hands.
In conclusion, charter plane booking offers a luxurious and convenient way to travel for those who value privacy and comfort. By following this complete guide, you can navigate the process with ease and ensure a seamless and stress-free travel experience.
So why wait? Book your charter plane today with continuum aviation and embark on your next adventure in style!

Top Ground Handling Services You Need to Know in 2024
Ground handling services play a crucial role in the aviation industry, ensuring the smooth and efficient operation of airports and airlines.
As the aviation industry continues to grow and develop, the importance of efficient and reliable ground-handling services cannot be overstated. From baggage handling to aircraft maintenance and cleaning, ground handling services are crucial to ensuring that flights run smoothly and passengers have a positive experience.
In this blog, we will take a look at the top ground handling services in 2024
Automated Baggage Handling Systems:
One of the most significant advancements in ground handling services is the implementation of automated baggage handling systems.
These systems utilise cutting-edge technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics to streamline the baggage handling process. By automating tasks such as baggage sorting, loading, and unloading, airports can significantly reduce the risk of mishandled baggage and improve overall operational efficiency.
According to a blog by Airport Technology, The London Stansted Airport uses the Beumer autover system which uses the latest digital technology that will future proof baggage operation for years to come, improving performance for both our passengers and airlines.
Passengers can expect faster baggage delivery and reduced waiting times, enhancing their travel experience.
Biometric Identification and Security:
Biometric technologies such as facial recognition and fingerprint scanning will be used to enhance security checks, immigration processes, and boarding procedures.
These advancements will not only improve security but also expedite passenger flow, reducing queues and wait times. Additionally, biometric identification can enable seamless travel experiences, allowing passengers to navigate through airports without the need for physical documents.
Emirates introduced Sara as an innovative portable robotic check-in system, which can match faces with scanned passports, check-in passengers, and guide them to the bag drop area, at its City Check‑in and Travel Store.
Sustainable Ground Handling Practices:
There has been an increasing focus on sustainability, ground handling services in 2024 will prioritise environmentally friendly practices.
Swissport International (one of the largest ground-handling service providers) focuses on sustainability and reducing its environmental impact.
Airlines and airports will adopt sustainable initiatives such as electric ground support equipment (GSE), renewable energy sources, and waste management systems. These practices will help reduce carbon emissions, minimise noise pollution, and promote a greener aviation industry.
Enhanced Passenger Assistance Services:
According to a blog written by Future travel experience, There has been a big acceleration of robotics and automation on the ramp and there is now quite an advancement in personal assistant robots, as evidenced by their prevalence at CES 2024.
Advanced technologies such as chatbots and virtual assistants will be deployed to provide real-time information, answer queries, and assist passengers throughout their journey.
Additionally, airports will invest in improved signage, wayfinding systems, and multilingual staff to ensure a seamless and stress-free travel experience for all passengers, including those with special needs.
Conclusion:
As we look ahead to 2024, the ground handling industry is poised for significant advancements and innovations.
These services are just a few of the top ground handling services that will shape the industry. They will not only improve operational efficiency but also enhance the overall travel experience for passengers.
By embracing these trends, Continuum Aviation aims to stay ahead of the curve and provide a seamless and enjoyable experience for travellers in the years to come.

Airport shuttle services are a popular choice for business and leisure travellers, as they provide a stress-free way to travel to and from the airport.
They are convenient for those travelling with bulky luggage or in large groups.
Overall, airport shuttle services offer a reliable and comfortable way to reach and get picked up from the airport, making them a popular choice for many travellers.

Plan: It's advisable to book your airport shuttle in advance, especially during peak travel times or in high-demand areas. It ensures availability and allows you to secure the best options for your travel needs.
Research Options: Take the time to research different airport shuttle providers in your destination area. Look for reputable companies with positive reviews, reliable service, and a track record of punctuality. Some websites you can book from:

Additional Services to Consider
Meet and Greet: A driver will wait for you at the arrival gate with a name sign, assist with luggage, and escort you to the vehicle.
Child Seats: Available upon request to ensure the safety of young passengers.
Wi-Fi Access: Some shuttle services offer complimentary Wi-Fi to keep you connected during your ride.
Multi-stop Option: Allows you to include additional stops on your way to or from the airport, useful for picking up friends or stopping by a hotel.
24/7 Availability: Ensure the shuttle service operates around the clock to accommodate early morning or late-night flights.

All About Aviation Fuel Services
Keyword: Aviation Fuel Services
Aviation fuel services are a critical aspect of the air travel industry, ensuring that aircraft are supplied with the necessary fuel to operate safely and efficiently.
From fueling commercial airlines to private jets, aviation fuel services play a vital role in keeping air travel running smoothly. Behind every successful takeoff and landing lies a network of aviation fuel service teams dedicated to providing high-quality fuel, impeccable logistics, and expert support.
In this blog, we will explore the aspects of aviation fuel services, including the types of aviation fuels, fueling procedures, safety measures, and the importance of reliable fuel providers.
Understanding Aviation Fuel Services
Aviation fuel services encompass a wide range of functions and operations designed to supply, manage, and distribute fuel for aircraft. From fuel procurement and storage to fueling operations and quality control, these services are essential for maintaining the integrity and reliability of aviation fuel systems.
Let us explore some of the aspects of aviation fuel services:
Fuel Procurement:
Fact: A Boeing 747 with a typical amount of passengers and cargo tends to burn a little over a gallon of fuel every second. It roughly estimates to about 3,804 gallons of fuel per hour, meaning that a Boeing 747 travelling from New York to Los Angeles, about a five-hour flight, would consume almost 20,000 gallons of fuel.
Aviation fuel services are involved in the sourcing and procurement of fuel from refineries, distributors, and suppliers. This process requires meticulous planning and coordination to ensure a steady supply of fuel that meets the stringent quality and safety standards set by aviation authorities.
Fuel Storage and Handling:
Once procured, aviation fuel is stored in specialised facilities equipped with state-of-the-art storage tanks and infrastructure. These facilities adhere to strict safety regulations and protocols to prevent contamination, spills, and other hazards.
Additionally, proper handling procedures are implemented to maintain fuel quality and integrity throughout the storage and distribution process.
Fueling Operations:
Aviation fuel services encompass fueling operations conducted at airports and airfields worldwide. Trained professionals, known as fuelers, are responsible for safely and efficiently refuelling aircraft according to established protocols and procedures. It includes conducting pre-flight inspections, monitoring fuel levels, and adhering to strict safety guidelines to prevent accidents and ensure the safe operation of aircraft.
Quality Control and Assurance:
Source: ARC-refuellers
Ensuring the quality and purity of aviation fuel is paramount to the safety and reliability of flight operations. Aviation fuel services employ rigorous quality control measures, including regular testing, sampling, and analysis, to verify fuel purity, composition, and performance characteristics.
Any deviations or anomalies detected are addressed immediately, to maintain the highest standards of fuel quality and safety.
The Importance of Aviation Fuel Services
As written in a post by Medium, Airlines, private aviation firms, and other organisations that operate flights depend on aviation fuel supplies as a necessary component of the commercial aviation business.
These services include finding, providing, organising, and analysing aviation fuel so as to make sure it satisfies the strict requirements to feed the effectiveness and safety required of flight travel.
Aviation fuel services play a critical role in the functioning of the aviation industry for several reasons:
Safety: By adhering to strict quality and safety standards, aviation fuel services mitigate the risk of fuel-related incidents and ensure the safe operation of aircraft.
Efficiency: Efficient fuel procurement, storage, and distribution processes minimise delays and disruptions, allowing for smooth and timely flight operations.
Reliability: Reliable fueling operations and quality control measures instill confidence in airlines, pilots, and passengers, ensuring the uninterrupted flow of air traffic.
Environmental Sustainability: Advancements in fuel technology and sustainable practices contribute to reducing the environmental impact of aviation fuel, promoting eco-friendly aviation practices.
Types of Aviation Fuels
Each type of fuel has specific properties that make it suitable for different aircraft and operating conditions.
Jet A1 Fuel- Jet A1 is the most common type of jet fuel for commercial and international flights. It is based on unleaded kerosene, a clear liquid with a low viscosity. It is considered to be one of the safest fuel types around.
Jet A Fuel- Jet A fuel is usually only available in North America.Jet A fuel is similar to Jet A1 but with a slightly higher freezing point.
Jet B Fuel- Jet B fuel was developed for improved performance in aircraft that are flying in extremely cold conditions. It is generally only supplied in countries like Alaska and Northern Canada.
TS1 Fuel- It is only supplied in Russia. It is adapted to the requirements specific for the Russian, military and commercial aircrafts.
100LL Avgas- Avgas stands for aviation gasoline. It is also known as the Aviation spirit in the UK. 100LL (Low Lead) Avgas is an aviation petrol used in piston-engine aircraft. This aeroplane fuel type is essential for small, general aviation aircraft.
Sustainable Aviation Fuels- As written in a blog by Flightworx, (SAFs) are a promising development, offering a greener alternative to traditional fossil-based aviation fuels.
Made from renewable resources like biomass, SAFs can significantly reduce aviation’s carbon footprint. They are designed to be ‘drop-in’ fuels, compatible with existing aircraft engines and refuelling infrastructure, making them a practical and eco-friendly option for the future of aviation.
Fueling Procedures
Aviation fueling procedures are highly regulated and require adherence to strict safety protocols. Fueling operations involve the transfer of large quantities of highly flammable liquid, so all personnel involved must be properly trained and follow established guidelines.
This includes proper grounding of the aircraft, use of fire extinguishing equipment, and careful monitoring of fuel levels to prevent overfilling.
Safety Measures
Safety is paramount in aviation fuel services. Fuel providers must comply with industry regulations and standards to ensure the safe handling and storage of aviation fuels. This includes regular inspections of fuel storage facilities, maintenance of fueling equipment, and training of personnel in fuel handling and safety procedures.
Adherence to safety protocols is crucial in preventing accidents and ensuring the overall safety of flight operations.
According to Aircraft Refueller Company NV, consulting with aviation fuel experts to ensure compliance with safety guidelines should be top priority.
Importance of Reliable Fuel Providers
Choosing a reliable and reputable fuel provider is crucial for airlines and operators. Reliable fuel providers not only supply high-quality fuel but also offer efficient and timely fueling services. They understand the critical nature of fueling in aviation operations and work to ensure that aircraft are fueled promptly to minimise ground time.
Additionally, reliable fuel providers like Continuum Aviation prioritise safety and compliance with regulations, giving peace of mind to airlines and operators.
Conclusion
Aviation fuel services are an essential component of the air travel industry, encompassing the supply, handling, and delivery of aviation fuels to aircraft. With a focus on safety, efficiency, and reliability, aviation fuel services contribute to the smooth and safe operation of air travel around the world.

Behind the Scenes: How Airline Catering Has Evolved in 2024
Keyword- Airline Catering
Airline catering is a big part of the whole flying experience, and it's continuously changing. So it's worth keeping in mind how it can affect your flight. Travellers now expect more than just food on their trip; they seek culinary experiences that reflect their values. Providing diverse and high-quality food during flights affects customer satisfaction.
Airline catering has undergone significant transformation due to changing consumer preferences and technological advances like automated meal preparation systems.
Let's explore how airline catering has evolved behind the scenes.
1. Embracing Health and Sustainability
Industries have seen a growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food, and air transport is no exception. More and more people care about the food they eat and the environment.
This is making airlines rethink their food strategies to meet this demand. Airlines are working to offer menus that cater to these preferences, from plant-based meals to locally sourced ingredients.
According to a report by Skytrax, renowned for its airline and airport reviews, major carriers such as Emirates and Singapore Airlines have been at the forefront of this shift, incorporating more diverse and eco-friendly meal selections.
In addition, partnerships with sustainable food suppliers and initiatives to reduce food waste have become commonplace in airline catering.
2. Personalization and Culinary Innovation
Another major trend shaping airline catering services is the emphasis on personalization and culinary innovations. Airlines are making use of technology to make dining experiences more personalised.
Passengers can now pre-order or customise in-flight meals based on dietary restrictions, cultural preferences, and mood.
At Continuum Aviation, we understand the importance of accommodating individual preferences and using cutting-edge technology to provide a personalised dining experience.
Airlines have launched systems that allow passengers to create their in-flight menus based on factors such as dietary needs and past eating history.
In addition, collaboration with famous chefs and food influencers has created a wave of creativity in the ship's kitchen, which elevates the dining experience to new heights.
3. The Rise of Virtual Kitchens and Delivery Services
Due to the growing popularity of food delivery services and the move to a contactless experience, airlines have begun to explore partnerships with virtual kitchens and third-party delivery platforms.
This innovative approach expands the range of culinary products available to passengers and strengthens food service operations by reducing in-flight food preparation.
Major airlines such as British Airways have tested food delivery services that allow passengers to order their meals. Their favourite food can be ordered from local restaurants and delivered directly to the plane gate. This trend will improve the travel experience and create new revenue streams for airlines as travel demand changes.
4. Future Outlook and Challenges
The airline catering business continues to evolve as the industry adapts to changing consumer and market dynamics. Tech and sustainability are huge drivers of innovation, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows. There are some challenges to remember, like supply chain problems and meeting regulations. It's necessary to stay on top of these things to stay successful.
In conclusion, the evolution of airline catering in 2024 will reflect the convergence of consumer preferences, technological advances, and the industry. By prioritising health, sustainability, and culinary excellence, airlines are redefining the in-flight dining experience and setting new standards for passenger satisfaction.
Experience the difference with Continuum Aviation's airline catering services and take your in-flight experience to new heights.

Understanding Airport Security Measures in 2024
Keyword- Airport security
Airport security is a top priority for travellers worldwide, ensuring safe and hassle-free journeys through stringent measures and advanced technologies. As we step into 2024, understanding the intricacies of airport security is more crucial than ever. Unravel airport security measures with our guide to breeze through security with confidence.
1. Preparing for Your Journey
Before you set foot in the airport, familiarise yourself with the latest airport security protocols to streamline your experience. It's necessary to stay informed about what items are prohibited and restricted on flights to avoid delays and save time.
Check the website of your departure airport or airline for specific guidelines tailored to your journey.
2. Checkpoint Procedures
Airport security begins at the checkpoint, where travellers undergo screening to ensure the safety of all passengers and crew. Expect to encounter a series of security checks, including X-ray scans for carry-on luggage, metal detector screenings, and possibly advanced imaging technology for a thorough inspection.
Follow instructions from security personnel and be prepared to remove jackets, belts, and electronic devices for screening.

In 2024, airports have embraced advanced technologies to enhance security measures and expedite the screening process. From biometric scanners for identity verification to automated screening lanes for efficient processes, these innovations aim to improve security and passenger experience.
Familiarise yourself with these technologies to navigate airport security with ease.
4. Baggage Screening
Airport security checks your checked luggage for potential threats using specialised scanners. Advanced screening systems, such as computed tomography (CT) scanners, provide detailed 3D images of baggage contents, allowing security personnel to identify suspicious items more accurately.
Pack your belongings securely and follow airline guidelines to facilitate smooth screening.
5. Security Personnel
Airport security personnel are trained professionals dedicated to ensuring the safety and security of travellers. Approach security checkpoints with respect and cooperation, following instructions promptly to expedite the screening process.
If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to seek assistance from security personnel.
6. Stay Vigilant

Behind the Scenes: How Airline Catering Has Evolved in 2024
Keyword- Airline Catering
Airline catering is a big part of the whole flying experience, and it's continuously changing. So it's worth keeping in mind how it can affect your flight. Travellers now expect more than just food on their trip; they seek culinary experiences that reflect their values. Providing diverse and high-quality food during flights affects customer satisfaction.
Statistic: In the air, you lose on average 30 percent of the ability to taste, so airlines do a lot of work focussing on every ingredient that they pick.
Airline catering has undergone significant transformation due to changing consumer preferences and technological advances like automated meal preparation systems.
Let's explore how airline catering has evolved behind the scenes.
1. Personalization and Culinary Innovation
A major trend shaping airline catering services is the emphasis on personalization and culinary innovations. Airlines are making use of technology to make dining experiences more personalised. Passengers can now pre-order or customise in-flight meals based on dietary restrictions, cultural preferences, and mood.
Statistic: About 10 percent of total dishes served are ‘special meals’, in the same context.
Airlines use a new device called the viscosity metre,which measures how much a sauce will run depending on time and heat, so they can test the food first on the ground while making new menus. Airlines plan their in-flight menus at least six months in advance, and sometimes up to a full year ahead of time.
At Continuum Aviation  we understand the importance of accommodating individual preferences and using cutting-edge technology to provide a personalised dining experience.
In addition, collaboration with famous chefs and food influencers has created a wave of creativity in the ship's kitchen, which elevates the dining experience to new heights.
2. Embracing Health and Sustainability
Industries have seen a growing demand for healthier and more sustainable food, and air transport is no exception. More and more people care about the food they eat and the environment.
This is making airlines rethink their food strategies to meet this demand. Airlines are working to offer menus that cater to these preferences, from plant-based meals to locally sourced ingredients.
According to a report by Skytrax, renowned for its airline and airport reviews, major carriers such as Emirates and Singapore Airlines have been at the forefront of this shift, incorporating more diverse and eco-friendly meal selections.
In addition, partnerships with sustainable food suppliers and initiatives to reduce food waste have become commonplace in airline catering.
3. The Rise of Virtual Kitchens and Delivery Services
Due to the growing popularity of food delivery services and the move to a contactless experience, airlines have begun to explore partnerships with virtual kitchens and third-party delivery platforms.
This innovative approach expands the range of culinary products available to passengers and strengthens food service operations by reducing in-flight food preparation.
Major airlines such as British Airways have tested food delivery services that allow passengers to order their meals. Their favourite food can be ordered from local restaurants and delivered directly to the plane gate.
This trend will improve the travel experience and create new revenue streams for airlines as travel demand changes.
4. Future Outlook and Challenges
The airline catering business continues to evolve as the industry adapts to changing consumer and market dynamics.
Caterers make dishes on an industrial scale. Elements must be measured and cut precisely to fit the palette, which measures 15 x 10 x 3.2 cm on average. Catering companies have to be precise and measurements for ingredients should be perfect, which takes time.
Based on the blog from Medium, tech and sustainability are drives for innovation, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows. There are some challenges to remember, like supply chain problems and meeting regulations. It's necessary to stay on top of these things to stay successful.
In conclusion, the evolution of airline catering in 2024 will reflect the convergence of consumer preferences, technological advances, and the industry. By prioritising health, sustainability, and culinary excellence, airlines are redefining the in-flight dining experience and setting new standards for passenger satisfaction.
Experience the difference with Continuum Aviation's airline catering services and take your in-flight experience to new heights.

Understanding Airport Security Measures in 2024
Keyword- Airport security
Airport security is a top priority for travellers worldwide, ensuring safe and hassle-free journeys through stringent measures and advanced technologies. As we step into 2024, understanding the intricacies of airport security is more crucial than ever. Unravel airport security measures with our guide to breeze through security with confidence.
1. Preparing for Your Journey
On an average about six million people travel by flight in a day. The travelling process can be quite easy for frequent travellers, but sometimes mistakes can happen.
Before you set foot in the airport, familiarise yourself with the latest airport security protocols to streamline your experience. It's necessary to stay informed about what items are prohibited and restricted on flights to avoid delays and save time.
Check the website of your departure airport or airline for specific guidelines tailored to your journey. Make sure to check the guidelines for luggage, pets and large appliances.
2. Checkpoint Procedures
Airport security begins at the checkpoint, where travellers undergo screening to ensure the safety of all passengers and crew. Expect to encounter a series of security checks, including X-ray scans for carry-on luggage, metal detector screenings, and possibly advanced imaging technology for a thorough inspection.
Follow instructions from security personnel and be prepared to remove jackets, belts and electronic devices for screening.
3. Enhanced Technologies
In 2024, airports have embraced advanced technologies to enhance security measures and expedite the screening process.
From biometric scanners for identity verification, automated screening lanes, millimetre- wave body scanners, Internet of things (IoT) sensors, drones and surveillance systems these innovations aim to improve security and passenger experience.
Familiarise yourself with these technologies to navigate airport security with ease.
4. Baggage Screening
Airport security checks your checked luggage for potential threats using specialised scanners. Revolutionising Airport security systems, such as computed tomography (CT) scanners, provide detailed 3D images of baggage contents, allowing security personnel to identify suspicious items more accurately.
Airport security allows only a small amount of water with you onboard.The 3-1-1 rule states that a person can only carry one single quart size bag of liquids with 3.4 ounce (100 ml) items in it.
Pack your belongings securely and follow airline guidelines to facilitate smooth screening.
5. Security Personnel
Airport security personnel are trained professionals dedicated to ensuring the safety and security of travellers. Approach security checkpoints with respect and cooperation, following instructions promptly to expedite the screening process.
If you have any questions or concerns, don't hesitate to seek assistance from security personnel.
6. Stay Vigilant
Airport security measures are put in place to reduce risks and ensure the safety of passengers. However, it is necessary to remain alert and aware of your surroundings. Report any suspicious behaviour or unattended baggage to airport staff immediately and comply with security directives to help maintain a secure environment for all travellers.
Do not, under any circumstances, joke about things like bombs, explosives, hijacking, or anything to do with any of these things. Doing so can lead to (in extreme cases) arrest.
7. Future Developments
As technology continues to evolve, so will airport security measures. Stay informed about upcoming advancements in airport security, such as biometric authentication and artificial intelligence-driven threat detection systems.
These innovations enhance security while improving the efficiency of passenger screening processes.
In conclusion, airport security is a cornerstone of modern air travel, safeguarding passengers and aircraft from potential threats. By understanding and cooperating with airport security measures, travellers can ensure safe and smooth journeys to their destinations.

| 7An Invitation
I have led an Expedition of twenty-four women to explore leadership. W e set 
out with what we thought was a simple aim: to find ‘an approach to leading that 
resonates with women’ . For months we spoke to women across the world about 
leading and at the end we gathered to compile everything that we had learnt.
W e all undertook the Expedition because we were tired of watching women 
struggle to make sense of status quo leadership: a status quo mostly defined by 
men, and by women who think that to be successful they have to lead like men. 
What we discovered was not what we had anticipated; it was something far 
more exciting. W e don’t need to define ‘an’ approach, because leading is individ -
ual and personal. There are common elements, but they are not common to all, 
and they are not done in the same ways.
What we really need is a ‘map’ . With a good map, everyone can set their own  
compass and do their own Expedition. And everyone can find an approach to lead -
ing that works for  them.
This book is that map. 
Wherever you are in the world, whatever age you are, whether your leading 
is done in marketplaces or temples, homes or offices, families or communities, 
whether you play on sports fields or in orchestras, the book invites you to go on 
your own Expedition and offers you a map to help you find what works for you.
W e discovered something else that made us think again. The word ‘leader -
ship’ suggests something that is set in stone: rigid, overwhelming and pompous. 
And the word ‘leader’ feels like a position to which you are appointed, a role 
8 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
that too rapidly becomes a status or a right. But the act of ‘leading’ is full of 
Energy, ever changing and personal. So from now on we are going to talk about 
leading – rather than about leadership and leaders – as much as we possibly can. 
And we are going to redefine what leading is.
Last of all, our Expedition confirmed one more thing for us: we are not 
alone in our tiredness with status quo leadership. It is turning women away 
from leading at a time when the world needs women leading more and more. 
I hope you decide to explore and enjoy it. I did.

| 9Foreword 
Over a nearly thirty-five-year career that has afforded me great moments of joy 
and exhilaration, challenging times, difficult people, sad realisations of my lim -
itations, cheerleaders and allies who have nudged me, pushed me, encouraged 
and supported me, I have come to realise how much leading matters. And how, 
when done well, it can bring happiness to people around you.
For too long, we have been shown a uni-dimensional view of leadership; 
male, W estern, single-minded, aggressive and, most of all, recognised by one 
barometer alone – success as measured by wealth or power. And hence leader -
ship has not been seen as accessible to many people and, more particularly, to 
women. If women’s way of leading has been recognised at all, it has been as a 
subset of leadership. 
The Expedition brought us great clarity that women bear the burden of 
leading without being recognised or counted for, and that women lead differ -
ently; they do not identify with the markers of leadership as they currently expe -
rience it, and indeed blame most of the ills of the world on outdated, exclusive, 
unsympathetic, dominating styles of leadership. This idea of leadership has led 
many women to say: ‘If this is leading, I am not in’ , ‘If this is how leaders behave, 
I don’t want to be one’ , ‘If this is what it takes to be a leader, I am not up for it’ .
Over the last few decades, the need for women’s leadership in the context 
of ‘female empowerment’ has acquired a new urgency. The focus has been on 
why women leaders are needed and what is getting in their way. Sadly, many 
arguments emphasise a largely economic rationale. Look how world GDP will 
10 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
grow if there are more women in the workforce, say most economists. W omen 
make 50% of the world, how can they be excluded, exclaim the gender equity 
activists. Economically empowered women will have more voice and agency, 
say women’s movement leaders, thumping the table. All sound arguments, no 
doubt. 
But we wanted to do something a bit different. Not to enter the debate on 
why women should be leading but on how they will lead when they do.
This book brings out the voices of the thousands of women Julia has spoken 
to over the last few years. They were asked, perhaps for the first time, what they 
thought of leading and why they were unhappy with its current state. Through 
a process of painful ‘manthan, ’ an approach to leadership that resonates with 
women was born. A ‘manthan’ is a beautiful Indian word: it describes a churn -
ing or bubbling up, sometimes coherently, sometimes inarticulately, sometimes 
with sadness, sometimes dreamily, often with joy.
I have known Julia for over twelve years now. I remember with great clarity 
my first impression of her: direct to the point of being mistaken as brusque, 
fearless, not one to brook any stupidity, but almost gentle when it mattered and, 
most of all, curious, always asking why, not afraid to show vulnerability and 
strangely maternal, immensely proud of her children. As you read this book, she 
will coax you into doing an Expedition of your own, or at the very least make 
you realise in a sublime ‘aha’ moment that you are already on one. 
All this to say that I believe this book is important. Play with it, challenge 
it, embark on your own Expedition. Then, as I did, you will catch yourself not 
being authentic, maybe even role-playing; you will find yourself confused as to 
why compassion and motherhood and spirituality are seen as feminine but not 
good enough for leading; there will be moments when you will exclaim aloud, 
to the chagrin of those around you, then smile radiantly, nod vigorously or shed 
a quiet tear at the insights that will confront you; you will suddenly see people 
around you in a new light and, with a gasp, you will realise that people you least 
expected are actually leaders for who they are, as much as for what they do and 
how they do it. It is a very personal journey; after all, how you lead reveals who 
you are to others, but most importantly to yourself.
Foreword | 11
Enjoy your Expedition! This map will help you find what works for you. 
What you uncover will resonate with you because it accounts for your lived 
experience and your cultural context. For sure, leading is hard, with many mo -
ments of self-doubt, anger, frustration, perhaps even a desire to give up. But 
change cannot be affected from the outside. It will take the collective effort of 
millions of us to change deeply entrenched mindsets and systems that celebrate 
only a certain type of leading.

Thousands of women have been a part of this book: women in their teens 
considering the prospect of leading; women who are studying and deciding 
whether leading is for them; women leading their families and communities; 
women taking a break, who will be back to leading soon; women at work de -
termined to get leading right; women at the top of their career wondering if 
they have ever got it right; women juggling the many balls involved in leading; 
women fighting to be heard or for the very right to lead; women of all gender 
identities including non-binary people and transgender women; women in over 
100 countries with different roots, roles and beliefs. My thanks to all. 
Thank you to those who allowed me to interview you on the W omen 
Emerging podcast, who volunteered to be a guide on our Expedition or who 
have been part of our W omen Emerging community. 
Thank you to all of you whose voices are in this book. All 101 of you are 
listed in Appendix 1 with your formal job titles, in the book itself I just quote 
you. Somehow job titles overwhelm me. Sarah Henry, a member of the First 
Expedition, says they never used them: “Honestly, I still do not know what half 
of the members do in their real lives. I know the names of their partners and 
their family members and the biggest mistakes they made. One day I will get to 
what they do in the world.” (Podcast 49)

would like to.)
Most of all, thank you to the twenty-four members of the Expedition who 
have spent many long hours over the last year listening, sharing, questioning, 
reflecting, rethinking, refining and simply exploring. All have had competing 
demands on their time. All have tolerated my leading – sometimes good, some -
times poor, occasionally irritating, oftentimes fun – with great kindness. It was 
a long Expedition and a huge commitment. Thank you, Alia Whitney Johnson,

There was a wonderful richness and complexity in our group. W e did have 
much in common but there were many differences: in our histories, cultures, 
beliefs, stories and experiences. Amongst us were native and settler, colonised 
and colonising histories. W e all had different experiences of patriarchy, discrim -
ination and privilege. So our discussions were sometimes complex, heated and 
challenging. W e never attempted a monolithic definition of what it is to be a 
woman.
Some of us loved exploring without a clear plan, thriving in the white 
space and starting from scratch, not looking at existing models, definitions or 
research. And others of us found the ambiguity tough and would have preferred 
a clearer sense of where we were and where we were going. It was not always easy 
to come together. 
But we did come together, magically, as an amazing group of women with 
open minds and deep trust. Thank you, thank you.
It is important to say that this book captures the insights from the 
Expedition through my eyes, though, as you will discover, I rely on the voices of 
members because they so often expressed or illustrated ideas far better than me. 
Sometimes our voices are not as one. W e all had our own discoveries, in -
sights and revelations on our way. These differences reflect one of the big dis-
14 |14 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
coveries of the Expedition: that leading is a very personal thing, that there is 
no one way to do it, and that to pretend that there is a single way to lead is to 
do leading a disservice. It dooms people to struggling and inevitably failing to 
make one way fit all. 
In one thing we are as one: in the wish to share and help women as they 
undertake their own Expeditions. 
So we created a map. It’s very simple. It has three concentric circles with 
an infinity symbol lying flat over the top. The middle circle is called Essence. 
Then one circle out is Elements, and the furthest out is Expression. The overly -
ing infinity symbol is called Energy. From this base, the infinity symbol spirals 
upwards as it generates ever more Energy.
If you decide to do an Expedition, you can fill in this map so that it be -
comes your map. It will become thumbed and scribbled over as you unravel your 
Essence and how it shapes how you lead, as you pin down the Elements of your 
leading – which ones you will decide to jettison, reframe, find and combine 
(particularly tricky is combining what, on the face of it, may seem incompatible 
Elements) – and then as you discover ways to express your leading day after day.
It is the dynamic flow between Essence, Elements and Expression that gen -
erates the Energy of leading, which then starts to spiral upwards.
But I am getting ahead of myself. The map is simple, and it’s complex too. 
It will take this book to know it inside out.
For now, let me tell you a bit more about the First Expedition.
| 15The First Expedition
W e were twenty-four women of different faiths, cultures and abilities. The 
youngest of us was twenty-four, the oldest sixty-four. W e all worked in different 
sectors. W e all spoke multiple languages. Some of us were big thinkers, others 
big doers. Some digested in numbers, others told stories. Some had large fami-
lies, others small. Some smiled at a moment’s notice, others took our time. Real 
women, doing real leading, right across the world. 
I was the leader of the Expedition. I had started W omen Emerging in early 
2020 and pulled together the Expedition and the group of women in early 2022.
I became passionate about W omen Emerging in the early days of Covid. 
Many people were talking about how the world needed to be very different 
post-Covid, yet there was no real indication that it would be. And change felt 
all the more unlikely if the same people continued to be the leaders. The most 
obvious and speedy way to produce change seemed to be to bring many more 
women into leading. Y et the women I was talking to were very clear that it was 
not for them for many reasons, a big one being their perception of what leading 
entailed. (Podcast 13)
The trigger moment came when I was preparing to do a leadership talk on 
a programme for women working in many sectors across the world. I saw that 
seven out of ten of the books recommended on their reading list were written 
by men. That left three written by women, mostly about how to succeed in a 
man’s world. They were also all written by W estern authors and almost all fo -
cused on how to break through the glass ceiling to reach the corporate top table. 
16 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
None of the books were likely to resonate with the audience I saw in front of 
me. So I started W omen Emerging. Not to add another book to the list, but to 
develop something different. 
The idea of launching an Expedition came soon after. I cannot say that it 
was hard to persuade the twenty-four women to join it, despite the time com -
mitment, because it wasn’t. As well as the twenty-four women, we had two 
other women involved. Stephanie Khurana, a big backer of women social entre -
preneurs, agreed to take on the role of ‘enabler’ to help me design the process, 
judge the pace and ensure that we did not lose any of the twenty-four women. 
Lissa Y oung, a woman with a long career in the US military, agreed to be the 
‘disruptor‘. Her role was to push us to think differently; bigger, bolder, braver.
I remember asking Stephanie why she had agreed to take on the role, and 
she replied very simply: 
“W e all yearned for a new approach to leading, and there was a sense of 
possibility and hope that we could imagine something different and better. W e 
saw or felt deep down that the current constructs wouldn’t enable us to thrive.” 
What I now call the First Expedition started out in May 2022 and ended 
in February 2023. W e worked virtually: alone, in pairs, in working groups or as 
a whole group. W e gathered for half a day each month, online. Because of the 
time differences, some were in bed about to go to sleep and others were in bed 
having just woken up. Between these gatherings each of us explored, speaking 
to women leaders around the world. 
The Studio
It was not always easy to persuade everyone to explore widely and resist the 
temptation to try to pull things together. All the way through we used the anal -
ogy of going out to gather materials which we would bring back into our virtual 
studio. W e knew that we would eventually use the materials to draw up our 
approach. Every time we brought things back, we were tempted to pull up our 
sleeves and get going. But I would push everyone back out again to listen and 
search and keep exploring and gathering.
The First Expedition | 17
All the way, my own exploring was enriched because each week I hosted 
a podcast episode with amazing women, from midwives to supply chain ex -
perts and from established leaders in Botswana to young leaders in Pakistan. I 
brought all those insights and laid them out in the studio too. 
W e all adopted the studio analogy fast. Stephanie describes what she saw: 
“W e all had our own palette and brushes, clay and pottery wheels, marble and 
chisels. Some painted with water, others with oil. Some started with pencils. 
Some shared canvases, and others had their own. W e found that sometimes 
oil and water don’t mix. Great ideas, learning and innovation emerged at the 
edge of difference. W e found tensions among ideas. W e found biased perspec-
tives among ourselves. Our members explored their interior selves and exter -
nal context. W e cast wide nets looking at wherever leading could be uncov -
ered. Nothing was excluded. W e embraced messiness before order. Subgroups 
emerged, converged and dissolved as we worked through the complexities to 
surface more polished thoughts and better ideas. Ambiguity with little struc-
ture is hard to hold among a large group but it helped to foster deeper insights. 
Getting comfortable with the uncomfortable became a vital skill.”
Though it was on Zoom, we shared our discoveries every month. Our ups 
and downs, the twists and doubling backs, as well as the leaps forward. There 
were moments full of tears and fears and then moments when we simply stood 
aside and watched miracles happen.
W e did eventually all get together. After ten months we met in Bellagio, on 
Lake Como, in Northern Italy. W e were hosted by the Rockefeller Foundation 
and it was magical. Bellagio was our real-time studio, and we started pulling 
everything we had learnt and seen together and making sense of everything we 
had brought to the studio over the previous ten months. W e discovered that we 
had been dreaming, for sure. But that the dreaming had set us up well.
It was a bit strange finally being together. W e drew on every facilitating 
skill within the group. W e sang to each other and danced for each other. W e 
drew pictures and created models with play doh. W e found common ground 
and pushed each other to uncover the frictions. W e went on walks together 
and on our own. Some swam in the freezing February lake. W e wrote papers 
18 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
and then rewrote them. And we looked after each other as messages from the 
outside world came through about work and friends and family. 
Without knowing it we slowly uncovered the map by doing the journey 
ourselves without one. 
W e recognised that leading is complex and layered, a quality that is specific 
to each person. W e realised that how you lead has to be connected with who 
you are. That any Expedition had to be done in two parts, one internal and the 
other external, though they would weave together. That leading for us would 
forever be a verb.
W e realised how often we had found ourselves reframing what are often 
perceived to be women’s weaknesses instead as strengths. And slowly it dawned 
on us that the word that we were all using the most was Energy.
Perhaps, most of all, we were reminded of just how powerful women are 
when we work together. 
I don’t think we avoided either our own good or less good leading, and we 
didn’t idealise how women lead. Nor did our diverse group start to W esternise 
leading in the way that we had too often seen happen. And we didn’t shy away 
from important words such as motherhood and spirituality. 
W e focused right through our Expedition on talking to women. This was 
not to exclude men but simply to focus on women. W e all knew full well that 
many men are in search of a fresh approach to leading themselves and would 
welcome the outcomes of our Expedition. W e all knew men who are allies and 
who sometimes pay a high price for being so. But even allies can fall uncon -
sciously into old ways. So we focused on women, while certainly never leaving 
our sons out.
In the very early days of W omen Emerging, Vidya, Mona and I spent many 
hours thinking through what was to become the First Expedition. W e discussed 
our dreamy ambitions. Mine was that women all over the world would say, “if 
that’s leading, I’m in.” But even in those early days, we sensed that we were un -
likely to come up with one simple approach. 
Mona, once a banker, then a philanthropist, before taking on leading 
Equality Now, began talking about a prism: “The prism is a powerful meta -
The First Expedition | 19
phor. Each facet can represent our individual lived experience, the experience 
of our communities or diverse viewpoints. Rainbows come from prisms as all 
the inputs feed in to create a spectrum that is a combination of seven different 
colour streams which stand strong individually and as a blended palette. W e 
were determined that our journey would be like an incredibly beautiful prism: 
we would input our ideas, fears and hopes and the outcomes would resonate in 
whatever combination of thoughts, narratives and beliefs that collided to create 
the entire continuum of the world.” (Podcast 2) 
So this was what was to become known as the First Expedition. The first 
of many.
I invite you to do an Expedition yourself. But before I go about persuading 
you, let me clear one thing up.
W omen Lead Differently
Those of us on the First Expedition were very clear that leading is leading. It is 
unchanged whoever is leading, wherever they are on the gender spectrum. But 
our hunch was that what was different was how women lead. W e sensed that 
how they translate leading to action differs significantly.
So the first thing we did was agree a definition of the word ‘leading’ . 
Finding one was easier said than done, especially one that could survive even 
remotely intact when translated to many languages. W e agreed on the following 
as a collation of a few we uncovered:
Catalysing people’s ideas and actions
with purpose, motivation and momentum
to reach a goal and a shared vision.
With this as a starting point, we set out to test our hunch that women go 
about leading differently. 
Nandita Das, a beautiful and brave actress in India, encouraged us: “I be -
lieve all of us have multiple identities and no one  identity should be thrusted 
upon us. Having said that, I find my identity of being a woman unwittingly 
taking precedence over all other identities. Maybe because we are never allowed 
20 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
to forget that we are women. Given this, it is just natural for us to get drawn 
to each other with a greater sense of empathy. W e have a shared sense of expe -
rience, of knowing the world the way we know it. This doesn’t mean that every 
woman that we meet we are going to bond with, but there are more chances 
that we will. And yet the popular narrative, at least in India, is that a woman is a 
woman’s greatest enemy. I don’t even know where it came from.
“I did an Indo-Spanish film and it had an all-women crew: a woman direc-
tor, producer, cinematographer, sound recordist, costume designer, everyone. 
Initially I thought it was just a marketing gimmick. But out of curiosity, I did it. 
I wanted to see what it would be like. There was one thing that was undoubtedly 
more present on set and that was empathy. W e could be ourselves and could 
lean on each other more. W e didn’t need to hide our vulnerabilities or see them 
as a weakness. In fact, they became our strength.”
Katya Guryeva, who works in urban policy connecting global cities, is half 
Nandita’s age and lives on the other side of the world, but she expresses the 
same instinct: “There is a special kind of Energy and power that I have only 
felt amongst women, which is particularly strong when we come together and 
support each other. Something unique that we are able to draw from. W e have 
to find the way of leading which harnesses this power that we hold.
“It might be as simple as drinking tea with multiple generations. A grand -
mother, a mother, a granddaughter, a great granddaughter. W omen are full of 
juxtapositions. W e are soft and strong, flexible and anchored, protectors and 
vulnerable, grace and chaos. So perhaps understanding these differences, the 
multifaceted nature of what it means to be a woman, gives us a clue.” 
Every woman I spoke to over the First Expedition to a greater or lesser 
extent shared our hunch and the wish to test it. And, in so doing, to redefine 
leadership.
But none underestimated how hard it would be to do so. Even if you just 
think of the obstacles set by language. Leading is so often seen as being the 
‘best’: the winners in sport lead or the richest in business lead. Those at the peak 
of a pyramid. The ‘best’ rapidly drags us back to the status quo.
The First Expedition | 21
Anna, a glorious violinist whose ability to frame leading in musical terms 
never fails to intrigue, sees words as constantly getting in the way: “Leading is 
often associated with masculine traits. For example, when a woman is firm, she 
is perceived as aggressive, but when a man is firm, he is perceived as confident. 
Similarly, when a man is accommodating or soft spoken, he is perceived as less 
dominant or weak, but in a woman the same traits are perceived as caring and 
graceful. When a man shows empathy and is not afraid of vulnerability, he be -
comes phenomenal. When a woman represents the same qualities, she is just 
a woman. However, if her leading includes Elements of strength and firmness 
then she becomes a phenomenon.” 
So testing our hunch was going to involve unpicking a complicated laby -
rinth, with language playing a confusing role. But we were up for it. W ell, not 
all of us. Aparna Uppaluri, who was leading the Ford Foundation in India when 
she embarked on the Expedition, saw it more as throwing down a challenge 
than testing a hunch. 
“There is an assumption that there is a universal idea of leadership and that 
women’s leadership is a subset of that universal idea. W e are going to challenge 
this, and recognise that when a woman leads, she can lead very differently from 
how leading is assumed to be done.” (Podcast 11) 
It was at this point, though, that Selvie Jusman and Andini Makosinski, 
one a young investment banker in Singapore, the other a young entrepreneur 
and inventor based in Canada, rightly reminded us that status quo leadership 
may be largely defined by men, but many women embody it. For both, their 
worst bosses have been women. Andini said of hers, “she was a very old-school 
manager from the entertainment industry who had made her career in a ‘man’s 
world.’ It slowly became very clear to me that she had found herself fashioning 
her aggressive and toxic personality in order to survive in the business.” 
Selvie described the impact of the woman who framed what leading was 
for her at the start of her career: “I identified leadership with something that 
is more results focused, very much KPI driven, very individualistic. I thought 
leading was about creating a punishing environment. And the effect on me of 
22 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
this was to feel like every day I was walking on an eggshell, feeling fearful of 
committing mistakes.” (Podcast 7)
Laura Fleming, an ever-rising star in the energy field, based in Scotland, 
while recognising Selvie and Andini’s descriptions, was very clear that we could 
change this. Laura herself refuses to become such a leader, even though the push 
to adopt the status quo is strong in the overwhelmingly male sector she leads in: 
“I have just started a new role in a new organisation. I have had to make a huge ef-
fort in order to stay myself. I know that I was hired to do the job, to bring the best 
of myself and bring change to the organisation. So it is vital that I do not assim -
ilate to the company culture, but this is actually really difficult and exhausting 
to do. T o turn up as yourself in a predominantly male environment really takes a 
lot of effort and a lot of Energy. Especially because it is totally counterintuitive. I 
think as human beings, but as women in particular, we are so good at adapting to 
new situations. It has been a strength for evolution and helped us survive many 
situations. But in order to create change, we need to avoid this assimilation and 
bring our true authentic self. It is absolutely worth it. I have already seen the im -
pact that it has had on people around me.” (Podcast 20)
 Priyanka Handa Ram, who runs a network of schools in Botswana, was up 
for proving the hunch too. I had interviewed her for the podcast and though 
she may not have been a member of the First Expedition, she has since deter -
minedly set off on her own Expedition. “The story of leadership has been, up to 
now, based on ‘you need to be stronger, you need to take emotion out, it is not 
personal, it is business.’ I think it has been a dangerous single story. It is up to 
us to change it. As we go on our Expeditions, I think the plot will start to twist. 
But let us not fall into the same trap; there is no single story for women either. I 
correct myself; it is up to us to change the stories.” (Podcast 24)
So, with our hunch becoming rather less of a hunch and more of a convic-
tion, let us pick up why we undertook the First Expedition and why we propose 
that you undertake an Expedition of your own.
| 23Why Explore
There are so many reasons to set out on an Expedition: the status quo doesn’t 
resonate, fitting in isn’t an option, we crave something different. Leading is 
lonely, but it can also be wonderful. This might just be the tipping point of 
change, or simply that we are needed and in large numbers.
Not for Me
W e read leadership books and there are many, many helpful insights, but too 
often they don’t resonate. It’s not just that they address a status quo largely de -
fined by men, it’s also one in which many feel that W estern ideas dominate and 
emanate from a very corporate perspective. All this makes for a dissonance with 
many women.
Ayesha Mian, an entrepreneur and psychiatrist in Pakistan, returned frus-
trated from a leadership programme in the W est which came with a lengthy re -
quired reading list that did not captivate her. “Lots of pedantic self-help books 
on what would make a successful leader out of me. I never found the ‘khalish’ 
of leading. It’s an Urdu word that describes an upsetting feeling that something 
got missed. It’s not just that their models were not designed by women, they do 
not work for women either. And they even compounded the ingrained percep -
tion in women that we are not leaders. Y et we know that we need to dig deeper 
if we are going to create a different world.”
Many women agree. Ani Choying Drolma is a Buddhist Nun who leads her 
monastery in Nepal. She expresses the same frustration: “For many hundreds of 
24 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
years, women have been told what they should be doing, what they are, how a 
good woman, a good daughter and also a good nun should behave. How a good 
woman should lead. Our goodness is always validated by how we live our life 
according to somebody else.” (Podcast 18)
Pelonomi V enson Moitoi is a civil servant in Botswana and she puts it suc-
cinctly: “W e got caught in the narrative that men do it better.” (Podcast 25)
Sarah Henry, from the US, adds that “women do not get to define how 
they want to lead and are then put into leadership roles where the way they 
show up to lead is not valued. W e are still putting women in to survive and not 
thrive. W e badly need to find ways for women to step into leading their way.”
Meena Meenakshi Arundhati, a young student in India, hears the voices 
from around the world and sees the ridiculous side of all this. “It is not as if 
women have not always been leading. W e are not allowed to think of ourselves 
leading and yet I, like many of us, have always taken up leadership positions. 
They are just not labelled leadership positions. W e do the grunt work, lots of 
the administration and untangling of the messes. Lots of emotional and mental 
labour, not the glamorous or shiny part of leading. W e do all the messy work 
and very rarely wear the shiny shoes. And, even more crazily, an outcome of this 
is that many of us do not even know we are leading.” (Podcast 42)
So we need books that help us to be us and not someone else. Rather than 
be shoved into a status quo approach that doesn’t fit whether you are an en -
trepreneur, a nun, a social entrepreneur, a civil servant or a student. Indeed, 
wherever you lead.
Fitting In
It is not as if the fitting in option works that well either. Many of us are told to 
adopt the status quo if we want to be successful, and then in the same breath, we 
are told to be authentic in so doing. It does not make much sense.
And the trouble is that if you do allow yourself to get shoehorned into 
status quo leading, you quickly start to lose sense of who you are and why you 
agreed to lead at all. It’s a rollercoaster because what happens next is that the 
people around you spot that you are not being yourself and it gets much harder 
to lead them. Because you are no longer authentic in their eyes.

Yvette Hopkins, after a career in the US military, describes it perfectly: 
“I see some women stuck in a state of mimicry; she will have been given the 
authority, responsibility and accountability but she is shaped by the male dom -
inated construct and will emulate its guiding hand. She basically emulates it 
until she can no longer see herself in it.”
I spoke to Anna about how she sees this play out when women conduct 
orchestras. “I have the impression that they still feel the need to get into men’s 
clothes so that they are treated seriously by the musicians. I have never seen a 
conductor in a dress. It seems to be more comfortable to be in trousers. This is 
true, but I have the impression that something more is going on. I am not sure 
why women need to jump into some masks that they do not need to wear just 
to be heard and respected. I have a picture of leaders being either men in suits 
or women with very serious faces, glasses, red lipstick and black jackets. I ask 
myself if I really must learn how to fit into this, to adapt and cut my own edges.”
Hinemoa Elder, a child and adolescent psychiatrist of Māori descent in 
New Zealand, firmly rejects the pressure to fit in because she fell for it in the 
past. “Back in 2006 we were developing our Māori model of care for a new 
service. Management wanted to tick a box and also congratulate themselves 
in having a Māori service. W e were excited about the opportunity to ensure a 
culturally safe place and a way of working for our people to be recognised and 
supported. One day the kaumātua (elder) and I were required to go to a man -
agement meeting and left a pākehā (white) colleague to cover us and see one of 
our whānau (extended family). It was not the right decision. That was a good 
hard lesson.”
Laura, too, in her world of engineers, knows she has fallen for assimilating 
in the past. “Maybe now we are going too far and starting to behave a bit like 
men. What I have come to realise is that doing so is only going to get me so far. 
I need to show up as I am. Not just for the benefit of the company that I work 
for but also for me.” I laughed as Laura said this and asked her if she would now 
describe herself as a radical. Her answer was a twinkling smile as she said, “who 
would have predicted that?” (Podcast 11)

Katrina W ebb, an Australian Paralympian, says that the urge to fit in is so 
strong in all aspects of life that you are almost lulled into it, and then you get a 
rude shock. “Growing up with a hidden disability, my focus was not on leading 
but on being accepted. It took competing in three Paralympic Games and win -
ning three gold, three silver and one bronze medal to start celebrating the fact 
that I was different and could contribute so much more because I did not fit in.” 
W e have all done it. And not just at work. I have a strong memory of being 
persuaded to try to fit in by my extended family. They had come to terms with 
me being what they believed to be a radical when I was at work but wanted it to 
stop in the very traditional family. I have an enduring memory of once – only 
once – sitting in a room, fitting in, or attempting to, and wondering who I had 
become. Authentically lost.
Something Different
At first Andini looked at leading from a Gen Z perspective. “I expected myself 
to be more woke when it came to female leading, but the First Expedition was a 
wake-up call for me. I began questioning all my preconceived notions of what it 
meant to lead. All my life I had seen illustrations of strong patriarchal leading in 
fairy tales, news articles and films. I did not even know there could be a differ -
ent way to do it. My only visual concept of a female leader was someone akin to 
Miranda Priestly in The Devil W ears Prada. It was not until I was fully immersed 
in the nine-month-long Expedition that I understood the importance of what 
we were trying to do.” 
The First Expedition was a turning point for Vidya too, one she talks about 
in her foreword to this book. Like Andini, she had long imbibed restricting 
messages about leading. “Up to then my understanding of leading was very uni-
dimensional; perhaps because, at business school, and later over my career, all 
I encountered was a male definition and practice. In hindsight, it seems as if I 
had blinkers on and saw my role only as a follower. Besides, I was not impressed 
with some of the women leaders I met and perhaps was very judgmental of their 
style and found it lacking individuality and brilliance.

“ As I came into my own at EdelGive and met many amazing leaders, both 
men and women, almost all from civil society organisations, I found myself be -
coming comfortable with who I am. What most resonated with me was their 
authenticity. Their ability to show vulnerability. Their desire to know you as a 
person. Their unabashed interest in your personal life. Their open admiration 
for you; their simplicity and genuineness. No show of power, only compassion. 
And I learnt that this worked for me as well!”
So Vidya and Andini both woke up to the possibility of something different 
in leading. Andini now has the passion of a convert. Since the First Expedition 
she has been driving a project to reach sixteen-year-old girls all over the world so 
that they can undertake their own Expeditions. “I want to tell everyone to lead 
their own way. Because we can all be leaders, no matter our background, loca -
tion, socio-economic position or race. It is something we already possess within 
us; we just need to muster the courage to accept it within ourselves.” 
Vidya challenged us right at the start of the First Expedition: “Give me 
something I can believe works.” Like all of us, she then began to realise that it 
would not be about giving her anything but more about helping her and many 
other women find their own way to lead. 
Less Lonely
Leading is hard and often lonely. Yvette expresses it well: “Y ou do not wake up 
one morning and start leading. It is a lifelong pursuit of excellence. Y ou do not 
always get it right. There is no instruction manual. It is hard and that is without 
even layering in the complexities of being a woman; the fact that women have 
not been in the workplace for a very long time, that women take on additional 
burdens, jobs, tasks in society. And on top of this you wrap in biases about 
women. W e look at the world through a different lens and, let us face it, the 
world looks at us differently.” (Podcast 3)
Rouba Mhaissen, a leader of the Syrian diaspora, feels the same. “Leading 
definitely made me lonelier. No one ever tells you that you are doing anything 
right, but you get detailed feedback on what you get wrong. And on top of this, 
28 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
people start putting you on a pedestal. Even your close friends do it, even your 
family, your team, your community. 
“I think it is a big moment for women when we realise that the people 
around us see us as leading. I did not realise it until quite late on. When I saw 
that they looked up to me for strength, that was scary. It is when you realise that 
you have some power that you are sometimes scared to recognise yourself. It is 
hard and lonely, but it is also rewarding, especially if you are not on your own.” 
(Podcast 10)
Adding to this is Meena, who has not done that much leading yet in her life 
but has observed a great deal. She says, “most women leaders are charting the un -
charted. The stakes are always so much higher for women when they lead because 
women cannot afford to fail. And because they know that they will take respon -
sibility if things burn to the ground, they spend too much of their time making 
sure that nothing does burn and not enough on the bigger picture. T oo often, I 
see them doing almost maintenance leading. If anything has held me back in my 
leading it is not having much room to fail. Y ou have to be a trailblazer, an excep -
tional trailblazer. There seems to be no space for being normal.” (Podcast 42)
All through the First Expedition and the many weekly podcast episodes 
I hosted, I got used to hearing two expressions: ‘accidental’ leader and ‘reluc-
tant’ leader. Many women simply find themselves leading, wondering how to 
do it, how to transition to this new reality. This lonely new reality that Uma 
Chatterjee, a campaigner on human trafficking in India, describes as being put 
“up on a pedestal. People do not think you need any help anymore. Y ou still 
need to feel loved and valued but people do not quite perceive you as human 
anymore, with human needs. Y ou frequently feel hesitant or in need of space or 
of acceptance, but you cannot ask for them. Or you do not think you can ask for 
them. Leading becomes a very sultry, lonely space.  
“It does not have to be this way and it cannot be. Y ou have to search for 
human connectedness, relatedness and how to make leading more liberating. 
Leading is, after all, about connectedness, about being and becoming together 
even if you are leading.” (Podcast 7)

And, of course, let us not underestimate the forces we are up against. Forces 
that are about maintaining the status quo and are disinclined to let go of any 
power. It does help, when you face them, if you are surrounded by other women. 
I recently interviewed Anne Rugg Onwusiri. She plays rugby, and told me 
about ‘rucking’ . When a player has the ball but is down, her teammates rush 
across the field to ‘ruck’ over her. They form a sort of scaffold over her with 
their bodies, careful not to crush, strongly protecting her and making sure the 
ball isn’t ripped away from her while she is down. It’s a lovely analogy. Of course 
male players do it too, but I like to think that women players do it with love. 
Anne has named her own podcast ‘Black Girls Ruck’ . (Podcast 68) 
W onderful
There is nothing quite like getting leading right. It does not happen that of-
ten but when it does, it is good. There is a joy and a lightness, an Energy that 
makes the impossible seem possible, a pride in people and in work, a surprise 
and a delight that comes with it. A conviction that this is what it was all for. A 
knowledge that it is all just going to happen. It is an experience of bringing light 
to greyness, of being humans at our best. T o me, leading is ultimately about En -
ergy. And there is nothing quite like generating such Energy.
I remember feeling this years ago when we all sat down as a family, hav -
ing realised that my son’s wedding that was about to happen in two days’ time 
needed a final push – because a few things were not ready and a few other things 
had fallen apart – a push that only we could make. W e sat around the kitchen 
table and produced our plan and then we went out and spent two days flat out 
and we did it. W e each took turns to lead at different times and on different 
tasks. W e moved the leading between us easily. I remember it as us at our very 
best and will do so forever. The wedding was beautiful.
And I remember feeling it at Common Purpose – the NGO I founded and 
then ran for thirty years – as we pulled out of a recession that had done its best 
to destroy us. I was sitting after a team meeting watching the pride everyone felt 
at the ingenuity we had displayed, the culture we had built on, the systems that 
we had put into overdrive, the colleagues we had inspired to pull off not just a 
30 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
turnaround but even an acceleration. I remember, for once, reflecting that I had 
got the leading right. And I was very proud of myself and of all of us.
I have not always felt this way about leading. For most of my teens and 
twenties, leading was nowhere on my agenda except to try to undermine it 
wherever I came across it. I equated leading with abuse of power – it went hand 
in hand with elitism – and thought that leaders were people with unearned and 
undeserved titles. 
I then worked at a cooperative and discovered what it was like when there 
was no leading. My lasting memory was of walking up and down long corridors 
trying to get someone to make a decision, or even to decide who would make a 
decision. Not for me, leaderless groups. 
It was in my late twenties that I realised that if I wanted to change the 
world, I could not do it in the sixteen hours a day that I was awake. I needed to 
do it with others, and that meant I had to learn to lead. But I was going to do 
it my way.
That was the start of a long journey. No one can do leading for you or tell 
you how you should do it. It is a journey of learning, of never really know -
ing when you get there. Of knowing that if you ever did think you had got 
there, you would have already lost it. Y ou can learn from others’ journeys or 
Expeditions but only so that you can digest it yourself and decide which bits 
work for you and which bits don’t.
The latest leg of my journey has been taking part in and leading the First 
Expedition. I have learnt a lot and unlearnt even more. This is why I suggest that 
all women go on an Expedition. If you are at the start of your journey and con -
sidering leading, I recommend an Expedition so that you can accelerate your 
journey. If you are well on your journey already, do an Expedition so that you 
keep on learning and unlearning as you go.
I would like Enaya Noor Mian to have the last word on this. She was by far 
the youngest person involved in the First Expedition. She told me very fiercely, 
“Leading is something you need to be proud of. I think it is an honour, an 
achievement. Y ou have accomplished something if people look to you to lead 
them. I think that is a big thing. So do not tone it down and make it seem like 
Why Explore? | 31
it is not that big of a deal. I think leading is something I would be honoured to 
do.” (Podcast 42) 
Now the Moment
I suspect that the kind of change in leading that women yearn for is also yearned 
for by many men. Because as the world changes faster and faster, and the prob -
lems accelerate and spread, thinking about leading is shifting too. So there is 
an opportunity now to rethink leadership. The shift is uneven and certainly 
not happening in every company, government, village, temple, marketplace and 
home, but it feels like an opportunity is opening up, and that women will be 
crucial in redefining leadership.
I am now going to add another hunch to our first hunch: my hunch is that 
women’s approach to leading might be the right one for our times. It might even 
be the best way to restore the increasingly shattered link between leaders and 
the people they lead around the world.
For the many people who hesitate in backing hunches, listen to Bin W olfe; 
at EY she is in a perfect position to spot shifts globally: “Covid has required us 
to demonstrate really different leadership attributes. That is, to care for the peo -
ple you work with. I think we always knew it was there, but it took Covid to sur -
face it and bring it to the fore. The pandemic was like the human race was under 
attack. I think everybody felt nobody was exempt from it. Everybody needed to 
feel a sense of safety. And this was what they looked for from their leaders. Up 
to then, people intellectually knew it, but it stopped at that for most. 
“One of the most basic human needs is to be acknowledged and recognised 
for our individual uniqueness and our individual needs. It does not matter 
which culture you come from, you need to be heard and seen. Leading calls for 
people to relate to other people and acknowledge their need to be safe, both 
physically and psychologically.
“I think it really highlights the need for leading to be done with empathy. 
This is now one of the critical attributes we look for.” 
I asked Bin if she thinks this shift will endure and reminded her of an 
Expression she once shared with me: muscle memory.
32 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
“Let me illustrate muscle memory with an example. After an intense meet -
ing, work or family, you sometimes get into your car and start driving and be -
fore you know it, you are at your destination. Y ou do not really think about 
what you are doing, about each turn you make, you just sort of know what to 
do. That is what I call muscle memory, when you have done something enough 
times it means that you could actually do it without putting a lot of thought 
into it. It becomes second nature. Athletes do it; they practice thousands of 
times so that when they compete, they do not think.
“Leading requires muscle memory too. Covid challenged us to develop 
a different set of muscle memory. All of a sudden you saw very senior people 
conducting a very important meeting, and the kids wander in or the dog starts 
barking. That humanised people. I think we have accepted a lot more of these 
human realities in the workplace. 
“I am optimistic we will not lose the muscle memory, if for no other reason 
than that people are demanding it, both employees and customers. There is also 
a whole new generation demanding it and they will not relent.”
Such a shift must, surely, I suggested to Bin, provide a huge opportunity for 
women. “Y es, women are ideal for leading in this new world. Typically, they are 
better communicators and listeners. They are more emotionally intelligent, are 
better at multi-tasking, less inclined to race from problem to solution and far 
less likely to let ego govern their interactions. They are a perfect fit.” (Podcast 14)
It is not just in the corporate world that this shift is being observed. Claire 
Y orke, an expert in war studies in Denmark, observes it in conflict resolution: 
“There is evidence that women make a difference to the decisions made. That 
they are essential to peacekeeping and conflict resolution. They are often more 
in touch with their communities, especially in countries where you have very 
strong matriarchal figures who are a part of their community and know the vul -
nerabilities and the needs of the people within it. It seems obvious, but women 
are essential in designing solutions that reflect the people who are going to be at 
the receiving end of them.” (Podcast 38) 
I suspect that it is not just in strong matriarchal cultures, but that women 
are also at times more effective in countries where men are predominantly the 
Why Explore? | 33
leaders. Because women are able to set aside some of the challenges that arise in 
such environments: the egos and the need to be the person in control. In these 
situations, gender, rather than being the barrier, may well become the enabler. 
Yvette recognises this: “It is not until you get to a very senior position in 
the military that this approach to leading is recognised. Where the so-called 
‘soft skills’ finally start to emerge in greater importance. T raditionally, we do not 
train soldiers in such soft skills until later in their careers.” (Podcast 3)  
Bin is not surprised that you find such stories in every sector: “I do see that 
female leaders tend to be better at being more empathetic, and there is plenty 
of research to show this. I think this is one of those things that actually works 
to the advantage of female leaders. What I would love to see is all our female 
leaders really claiming this space. 
“Once upon a time, when there were discussions about emotions, they 
were something to shy away from. They were seen as ‘soft’ in a culture where 
you were told to be ‘tough’ . I think that things have changed, and it is a change 
which is here to stay. And I think that will really serve well for a lot of our fe -
male leaders.” (Podcast 14) 
W omen Needed
Over the First Expedition, I spoke to many women about what they see as the 
big drivers of this change. Three of them stand out and will frame the context 
in which we will be leading: AI, the global order and climate change. Each one 
badly needs women to be at the heart of addressing them. It simply cannot be 
done without women and in large numbers.
Artificial Intelligence
So far, AI is largely being designed by men, very seldom by women. So there is 
a fair chance that the old ways will be perpetuated in the data we are using and 
the conclusions we draw from the data.
Leila T oplic, whose life has taken her from refugee camps to becoming a 
leading global thinker on AI, can see this clearly: “The potential for artificial 
intelligence to serve humans is undeniable, and so is its ability to cause many ad -
34 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
verse impacts on an unprecedented scale. W e have this very powerful technol -
ogy that is generally applicable across everything we do and care about and we 
have a rapidly closing window of opportunity to design and shape its direction 
in a safe and equitable way.
“ AI is not magic. Its application will mirror our inherent human imperfec-
tions. As designers of AI systems, our biases, unfairness and injustices will inev -
itably surface, magnified on a massive scale. It is imperative that everyone who 
is leading is aware of this and proactively taking steps to mitigate risks through 
ethical design and implementation, as well as policy and regulation. 
“Part of this will mean adopting a deliberate approach in determining who 
builds and deploys AI, for what purposes and based on what values. This tech -
nology, which has an impact on all of us, should be collectively designed and 
shaped by all of us.” (Podcast 39) 
Speaking to Leila reframed AI in my mind not as technology but almost 
as a collaborator. One that is only as effective as we brief it, debrief it, debunk 
it and disagree with it. If we do not set the parameters for it, do not analyse the 
conclusions of it, do not occasionally disagree and overrule its outcomes, then 
AI becomes a threat. W omen are needed to play their part in this massive AI 
revolution, of course as coders and designers, but perhaps more importantly as 
the leaders who agree on the briefs, set the priorities and question the outcomes.
Lee Sue Ann, a thought leader in the ASEAN, is focused on one huge so -
cial outcome of AI. “Whether it is disinformation or misinformation, people 
are now really confused about what is true and what is false. And this is only go -
ing to get worse given the trajectory of AI. W e think that we have got a problem 
now just from the social media news feeds; we are soon going to have trouble 
figuring out whether it is really me right now talking to you, or if it is just an 
animation that has somehow managed to capture my voice and my gestures 
and pretend I’m speaking to you. W e are going to increasingly just build our 
networks at a local level, you know, in flesh and blood, almost go hyperlocal.” 
(Podcast 15)

Global Order
If AI cries for women to engage, the same must surely be said of the global order. 
For so long, the international and national principles of sovereignty, equality 
and national self-determination have been relatively consistent. But things are 
changing. Claire sees the breakdown of international cooperation and multilat -
eral order in very stark terms: “The differing perceptions for the future of the 
global order are going to be very hard to reconcile. There needs to be someone 
or some groups of people who are able to find common ground between them 
when different sides are calling out the other for their actions, their histories 
and their intentions. Because there is this kind of reckoning coming about what 
the future looks like and where we will we find security and stability.
 “It is as much an issue of international order as it is a domestic issue in a 
number of countries around the world where people are feeling marginalised 
by political and economic systems that they do not feel work for them. These 
local foundations will need to be far stronger for people to have the capacity, de -
sire and ability to be collaborative and cooperative actors on the international 
stage. Because if you have too much dominating the home front, it makes it very 
hard to commit resources and people or time and effort to collective solutions.” 
(Podcast 38) 
And this is in the context, says Sheila Paylan, an international human 
rights lawyer, of “international law turning authoritarian, because it is being 
misapplied and used by countries that want to launch wars and use the parlance 
of international law to justify their actions.” (Podcast 38) 
Claire has little hope of “someone, or a group of someones” finding com -
mon ground at the global level, even when we are facing such huge global prob -
lems, and when the world is full of what feels like an overwhelming number of 
frozen conflicts. 
Whoever the someone is, there will surely need to be many women 
amongst them. W omen like Paula Langton, who heads up a vast sustainability 
fund based out of London, who anticipates change emerging quite rapidly from 
a different place: the financial markets. She predicts that it will be global econ -
omies that will adapt the fastest. Just imagine, she challenges us, “if we took just 
36 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
1% of pension funds globally and diverted that for sustainability, that is 240 
billion that could go into decarbonising portfolios. And this is what investors 
are increasingly being pushed to do. W e are really at the start of this journey, but 
it will move fast.” (Podcast 39) 
Climate Change 
The scale of the challenges is daunting, and it is clear that poor, rural women 
in less developed countries will suffer direct, disproportionate harm caused by 
deforestation, water pollution, environmental toxins and the loss of ecological 
diversity.
W omen are often more awake to this than most. Many studies have showed 
how women on boards and top teams are successfully pushing for change. W e 
need women doing the same everywhere. Erum Khalid Sattar, who has devoted 
her life to water and sustainable water management, told me the best story to 
illustrate this: 
“This story is situated in rural Sindh in current day Pakistan. The tempera -
tures are very high; they can range between 40 and 50 degrees Celsius, so this 
is a hot part of the world. W omen in these rural areas have no access to piped 
water. They walk long distances to wherever the well or the watering hole is to 
collect water and bring it back for the daily supply that the family and farm ani-
mals need. It is back-breaking work and none of us should at all try to romanti-
cise it. W ater is very heavy. When you see those pictures of women carrying big 
water pots on their heads, think about it, carry a few books on your head and 
see how you feel. It is not easy carrying heavy water pots without spilling them. 
It is really hard work, and it falls to women.
“So let us now skip to the W orld Bank. In a very broad sense, the reforms 
that were promoted can be described as farmer managed irrigation with the idea 
being to increase the role of farmers in the management of large surface-water 
irrigation systems. This meant organising farmers into groups and water user 
associations. The members of these groups were basically men and there was 
no representation of women. There was not even a sense that there should be a 
token representation of women. 
Why Explore? | 37
“Imagine that you are the user of a resource and yet you are left out of any 
decision making about some of the most important ways in which water is used 
and the uses to which it is put.
“Switching to a personal memory from the time of my field work, I remem -
ber that there were many offices and conference rooms where I would be the 
only female, dressed as I may normally be dressed in bright colours and carrying 
a laptop in a bright Barbie pink cover. I’d find myself in a sea of sober colours 
worn by men, whereas when you visit women, in particular working in fields 
and in rural areas, you encounter a sea of bright popping colours, bright yellows 
and greens and pinks and reds and oranges.
“My hope is that if we are successful, we can actually enable the women 
most directly affected by how water is actually used in rural and agricultural ar -
eas into those – in many ways far-removed – spaces in which decisions are made 
that affect their lives. I want all of the lived toughness and vibrancy of women 
to come into that policy making space. I think the decisions we get through that 
dialogue and genuine understanding may begin to change many things in ways 
we cannot begin to imagine. W e must persevere in bright hope.” (Podcast 6)
Why did this story have such an impact on me? Because we talk too much 
about corporate boardrooms and women getting into them. In many ways, it 
is just as important that women get to the boardrooms in villages. The scale 
of the problems we face – especially those associated with climate change – 
requires it. And when women get there, we have to help them not to emulate 
and assimilate but to be different and demanding and confident and fresh. And 
themselves. With popping colours. And to be pulling together, especially across 
the generations. 
Because we must remember that climate change and the consequences of 
climate change are bringing women to the fore and together, but they also have 
the potential to divide generations of women in a big way. 
T wila Moon, a leading scientist in polar research, expresses this best: “For 
many people who are older, climate change was not something you learned in 
school. It was not a big part of education. So it has been a very rapid onset issue, 
not in the sense that scientists and many across the world actually did not un -
38 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
derstand this early on, but so much real conscious effort was put into muddying 
the waters around climate change that it has felt like a rapid onset issue that is 
moving very quickly.
“If you are young there is a particular frustration of being young and realis-
ing the full situation on climate change. Y ou also cannot see yourself being able, 
in a short period of time, to step into power and undertake change yourself. So 
you are really dependent on older generations and people in power now to do 
something now.” (Podcast 38)
Francesca Cavallo, whose fabulous Rebel Girl books are probably lining 
your shelves, sees this playing out across three generations: “There is young Gen 
Z, then there are women that are now around 50 years old and then there are 
the grandmothers. Grandmothers and Gen Z, on the sustainability issue, are 
closest, which is an interesting phenomenon.
“It may be because people who are now in their seventies and eighties re -
member a world that was more sustainable, whereas the generation of people 
who are now around fifty are sons and daughters of the economic boom, where 
part of their privilege was built on ignoring the environment and the challenges 
of the infinite growth. 
“I believe that there is a lot of need to speak about these issues with an open 
mind and not assume bad faith from any of the people involved. This is increas-
ingly important because, as we live in an incredibly polarized society where peo -
ple want to overlap completely, with the party that they vote for or their system 
of beliefs, that leaves too little room to grow as a society and to understand that 
we do not need to agree on everything to do something together.” (Podcast 38)
So we are in times of great change. Of great leaps forward. The algorithms 
of the world are in design mode and they have to be given the scale of the prob -
lems we face. These three in particular scream for women to be at the heart of 
addressing them. AI needs women designing, framing and questioning it. The 
global order needs women who can bring people together. And climate change 
needs women to work across generations as has seldom been seen before.

Ready to Go
The last compelling reason for women to undertake Expeditions and engage 
ever more in leading is that the trailblazers need back up.
The work being done to produce systematic change – so that the odds of 
women emerging and succeeding as leaders are not so heavily stacked against 
them – needs to be complemented with a steady supply of women choosing to 
lead. For this to happen we have to make leading something we gladly choose to 
do, and say, “If that’s leading, I’m in.” 
Putting this right in the vast movement that is women’s empowerment across 
the world may seem like filling in a tiny piece of a huge jigsaw, but it is crucial. 
Because without it in place, many women are deciding not to lead and, as a result, 
their talent, experience and insight is being wasted at a moment when the world 
really needs it.
Of course, things will not suddenly change just because women lead in a way 
that works for them. They will still be operating in systems that are evolving very 
slowly. I hear people claim that things are changing for women, and they certainly 
are, but very slowly. Think what a computer looked like twenty years ago versus 
what we have in our pockets now. Think of the speed of that change. Now think 
about how quickly things have changed for women. The pace has been glacial.
Catherine Ruggles, who still describes herself as a geek even after years at 
the top in STEM (Science, T echnology, Engineering and Mathematics), observes 
how true this is: “I love computers, I love all the stuff about them. So when I 
started out over forty years ago in the technology field, I did not really have to fit 
in. I certainly did not have to go through what I think young women have to go 
through now, which I think is horrible. The twisting yourself into a doughnut to 
change your personality and act like a guy in order to be successful. I don’t think 
I would have done well in the world that we have now.”
Catherine as a doughnut, it made me laugh. “Y ou mean an authentic dough -
nut, ” I said. Her response: “There you go. Don’t you love that? It’s a riot. And it 
is kind of extraordinary how good men just do not see it or get it. A few men do, 
but I will say very few.”
40 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
I asked Catherine what she says to young women today. “That it is not them. 
That it is not a level playing field. It is not a meritocracy. If they do not succeed 
at something, it’s not necessarily their fault. The concept of meritocracy has done 
huge damage. There is no meritocracy in lots of organisations. But there is an illu -
sion of one. The trouble is that many people at the top genuinely believe that their 
organisations are meritocracies. They believe that they really did devise a system 
that was meritocratic and inclusive. But they are not, and this has had some really 
wicked consequences. It leaves women thinking that their problems are individ -
ual to them and not the result of the so-called meritocratic system. They think, 
‘it must be because I’m not good enough.’ And it leaves a lot of young men who 
come in, like the young women, thinking it is a meritocracy, saying, ‘if there are no 
women around here it must be because they cannot hack it.’
“W e cannot keep on talking about inclusion and make so little progress. 
There are some uncomfortable conversations that need to happen. Almost cer -
tainly led by women, particularly women with privilege, because it is near impos-
sible to take on the system if your household is dependent upon it.” (Podcast 33)
While Catherine sees it from the corporate angle, Sheila Paylan sees the same 
but through international law eyes: “I am one of those women who wants a seat 
at that table, and I have one in a small way. For example, when I lived in Congo 
I was there as the expert on conflict-related sexual and gender-based violence. I 
was in a team of forensic experts. W e were there to help the Congolese military 
authorities investigate crimes. My role was to make sure that we took rapes into 
account and that this form of violence was not forgotten but treated as part of the 
whole picture. 
“I was sidelined. My team members did not understand what my role was, 
nor did they see it as a priority. They tried to shut me down with ‘W e’re here to 
investigate murder.’
“W e are just going to have to demand our seat at the table. And then demand 
we keep it and get heard. T alk to a survivor of conflict-related sexual violence, you 
will see how indomitable we are. That is the word, indomitable. That is what we 
have to be.” (Podcast 38)

Alia Whitney Johnson has driven change on behalf of young women in Sri 
Lanka and California. She reflects on the indomitability of the women in Sri 
Lanka: “W e worked with young women who have been totally cast out, who liter -
ally all of society has turned their back on due to rape. Y et they are willing to stand 
up in front of their whole village in public court, some as young as age eleven, with 
everybody there, to say, ‘this is wrong, and I do not want my sisters to go through 
it’ .” (Podcast 8) 
Such indomitability is a huge ask. Not every woman will be up for it, and nor 
should they have to be.
It is the same question everywhere, and especially in politics. Isata Kabia de -
scribes her journey as a politician in Sierra Leone: “The first hurdle is that you 
need money. Then to get ‘permission’ from partners or husbands or some family 
member. And once you are able to get that, you are kind of beholden. Permission 
can be withdrawn in a second. If the wife comes home late from a political meet -
ing, the husband can decide that she can no longer participate, and campaign 
money grinds to a halt. 
“ A man can come home and announce to his family that he has decided 
to run for office without any consultation, and then he can take the baby’s milk 
money and spend it on the campaign. 
“When you get into office, you are judged not by what you do but by how 
much your family is suffering from what you are doing. ‘Oh, your poor husband, 
your poor kids’ . Added to this, all those who are about maintaining the status 
quo are going to be after you morning, noon and night. Because the moment you 
decide to run for office, you are challenging power. 
“Then the insults start, tailored, ready-made, in waiting for a woman who 
raises up her hand or her head. The words, the abuse, the violence. A steady and 
relentless stream.
“From the beginning you have to kind of make yourself small for people so 
that they are on your side. It is a fight, a daily fight.” (Podcast 4)
So for these extraordinary women who are fighting for systematic change, 
we must supply women ready to lead, and who have decided to lead their way. So 
that when extraordinary women make the breakthroughs and then turn round to 
42 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
check who is coming next, ready to go through these doors that have been prised 
open, there are plenty of women saying, “I’m in.”
So there you have it. The reasons, the multiple and compelling reasons, to 
embark on your own Expedition. Whether it is because the status quo of lead -
ing doesn’t resonate with you or because you yearn for something different. Or 
simply because leading is a lonely journey even at the best of times. Whether it’s 
because leading is glorious and exciting and you want to get better and better at it 
or because you want to play your part at the moment when leading might just get 
redefined. Or because you have a deep sense that the world faces problems that 
call for all of us to lead, to scale and in popping colours. Or it may be none of the 
above; you just want to be ever better at leading.
Whatever the reason, explore.

Take a moment
If you are considering doing an Expedition, go through the reasons why the mem -
bers of the First Expedition chose to do theirs and rate how much each reason reso-
nates with you (5 is high and 0 is not at all). Y ou might have more reasons that are 
specific to you. Add them and rate them too. The rating is simply to indicate how 
important each reason is to you. Y ou could then think how you might have rated 
each one differently five or ten years ago.
Make a list of the people you might like to talk to about how they lead if you 
decide to do an Expedition.
At this very early stage, write down your hunch about what an approach to 
leading that resonates with you might looks like. Y es, this is a deliberately vague 
question. Just go for it. Don’t overthink it or worry about the drafting, just write 
down what comes to mind. It will never be published, it does not have to be perfect, 
it can just be a stream of thought. Keep it short. 
44 |Your Expedition
Solo or T ogether
Y ou don’t have to do an Expedition at all. Y ou can simply enjoy this book and 
consider a different way of leading. With so many women’s voices in the book 
you will probably feel like you have been on an Expedition anyway by the time 
you have finished reading.
If you do decide to embark on an Expedition, you can either do it on your 
own or you can decide to gather a group of women and go on an Expedition 
together.
If you decide to explore solo, at your own pace, put some time aside in 
the coming days or weeks to speak to leaders either in your networks or in the 
W omen Emerging community. Look out for the sections at the end of each 
chapter that suggest activities. Also watch out for the weekly podcast which you 
will probably enjoy. Y ou can find it on whichever podcast platform you use. W e 
also do a live online masterclass every three weeks which you are most welcome 
to join or listen to. For this you will need to register on the W omen Emerging 
website, then you will get an invite.
If you decide to form an Expedition group, you want to carefully think 
through who might be in it. It is infinitely more interesting if it is a diverse 
group full of women who are likely to prompt each other to think and think 
again. Y ou could choose to be local (so that you could actually meet up physi-
cally sometime) or to be a group of colleagues from one organisation or sector. 
Your Expedition | 45
Alternatively, you may want to look wider and seek out women who are in dif-
ferent regions, countries or continents. If you do this, keep the practicalities of 
time zones in mind when setting up your calls. Whichever option you go for, 
keep diversity firmly in mind; it will give you much more insight. Consider 
women in different sectors, specialisms, geographies and generations with dif-
ferent backgrounds and beliefs. T ry to go for people who are sufficiently open-
minded, humble and curious to enjoy an Expedition.
Again, watch out for the activities and questions at the end of each chapter 
as well as the podcast episodes and online masterclasses.
I also try to join a few Expedition groups each month to hear their think -
ing and answer any questions. So please do invite me.
Y our Journal
Whether you go solo or with a group, get a journal. I had a journal. It was full of 
pictures, quotes, diagrams, arrows, stick it notes, crossings out, scribbles, draw -
ings. It made very little sense to anyone other than me. I found it helpful to 
catch ideas and questions, ones that made sense and ones that didn’t. Since my 
Expedition I have found it interesting to look back at my discoveries and pivots, 
the moments of darkness, of shadows and of light as well as the ideas I was play -
ing with at different times. When you get to the end of each chapter, consider 
the activities and questions and keep capturing everything in your journal as 
you go.
I am glad I wrote the journal because I think, if I hadn’t, bits would have 
got lost. I have continued to learn and rethink since the Expedition, so it is 
helpful to look back on why I thought what I did.
Y our List
Y ou need to think about who you want to speak to while you are on your Expe -
dition. Think widely, make sure you seek out unfamiliar voices, people with very 
different thinking from you. Look for women who are double or half your age. 
People who were born on another continent from you. Think about the men 
you might talk to, whose approach to leading you think might resonate with 
46 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
you. If you engage with the W omen Emerging community either on LinkedIn 
or the website, seek out people to talk to. W e leave it to you to connect.
W atch out for the numbers at the end of some of the quotes throughout 
this book. They are quotes from leaders whom I interviewed for the W omen 
Emerging podcast. Listening to them gives you a lot more context and you will 
love their stories. 
Good Luck
Please, as your own Expedition comes to an end, share what you have learnt on 
the W omen Emerging website. The map will never be complete, your compass 
will always need readjusting. W e need to share a constant flow of insights and 
practical advice and treasure it on the website.
I wish you luck as you read on and explore, maybe with Aparna’s words in 
the back of your mind: “W e wanted to wedge open and really take apart what 
it means to be a woman. T o find the source of Energy inside. And let leadership 
emerge from that.” (Podcast 11)
Before Y ou Set Off
I asked all the members of the First Expedition to share their tips:
Start Right
Sit back not forwards, start with a smile, abandon all hope of simple answers, 
just take it all in and see where it takes you.
Ready to Pivot
Pivot on the big things and the small. Get the diary organised so that you use 
your time well and don’t waste other people’s time, but then be realistic; we 
all have competing priorities and balancing acts to perform. When plans need 
changing to help others, change them. 
Alia: “I came into the Expedition thinking about leading others. Halfway 
through, I am re-discovering the importance of leading myself.” 
Your Expedition | 47
Multiple Languages
Seek out people who speak other languages from you. They will see things dif-
ferently and express ideas differently. It will constantly remind you how poor 
words are at expressing complex or personal thoughts.
Keep That Journal
Ana Luz Porzecanski, a scientist who has led countless Expeditions, said, “you 
need to learn and to document what you are learning. Y ou really have to, be -
cause otherwise it eventually evaporates. Make your journal personal, record 
what you are learning about yourself and about the systems you are embedded 
in.” (Podcast 2)
Be Brave
Mona: “My fear at the beginning, which dissipated rapidly, was that because the 
patriarchy had already defined the parameters of leading, we would find it im -
possible to deviate from them. W e would not be motivated to delve into places 
of discomfort. Let’s face it, it is uncomfortable to have your alternative theory 
of change probed and poked at.” (Podcast 2) 
Not Knowing
Stephanie: “Enjoy ambiguity. Resist the instinct to overthink, even if it is hard 
because we all want to know where we are going, but wherever it eventually is 
will not be familiar. Determinedly avoid the temptation to define answers be -
fore you have uncovered all the overlooked possibilities.” (Podcast 37)
Go Justajoo
Ayesha introduced me to the Urdu word ‘justajoo’ , and when I used it with Uma 
it made her smile. She explained why: “It means an Expedition, but one whose 
source is not only to find something. It is not only the pot of gold at the end of 
the rainbow. It is the seeking, which is beautifully pleasurable in itself.” Uma’s 
eyes twinkled. “It is a very warm word. A word that talks about the innermost 
or instinctual spiritual desire for something or somebody, of  the innateness of 
48 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
love, warmth and pure desire. It just makes me feel ... it just brings a smile to my 
eyes and my lips.” (Podcast 7)
Then some added tips if you are exploring as a group:
Add Art
When words failed us, music did a better job. It pulled us together, opened us 
up, revealed things about each other. Share, discuss, perform art together in -
cluding cooking. If you get together physically, cook for each other. Or chop up 
for the cooks. Or wash up for the cooks.
Listen to Diversity
Stephanie: “If you have taken the trouble to form a diverse group, do not try 
to make it all the same when you get going. Don’t shy away from the diversity 
in the group, especially the diversity in age. W e learn through our differences, 
not our similarities. The nuance and texture of what people share about leading 
from divergent perspectives is both revealing and hard to navigate.”
Build in Play
Alia: “Play can help us build trust, think outside of the box, flip hierarchy and 
change power differential.” 
Meander 
Vidya: “W e learnt to stay away from the temptation to arrive at a consensus. 
Rather to go wide and even meander a bit, only narrowing down and coalescing 
at the very end.” 
Enjoy W omen
Hinemoa: “I went on an Expedition to the Antarctic Peninsula at the end of 
2019. If you get a chance to go anywhere close to Antarctica, seize it with both 
hands. One of the things that I learned was that large groups of women get on 
really well together. And yet we heard nothing but comments such as ‘it’ll be so 
Your Expedition | 49
bitchy, there’ll be so many little factions. Y ou’ll all be fighting with each other.’ 
It just was not the case.” (Podcast 1)
W orrying about this caused Laura to almost miss the First Expedition: “I re -
ally thrive in a group that is diverse, yet this was going to be all women. W omen-
only groups kind of remind me of school days and I really, really did not enjoy 
them. So up until going on this Expedition, I had veered away from all-women 
groups. But it has not been like that.” (Podcast 11)
Expect the Unexpected
Ana Luz: “I went on a scientific Expedition to Cuba. Our vehicle broke down 
in the middle of nowhere, it rained for two days straight so we could not set 
up camp, a permit was revoked so we could not go through a certain area. Y ou 
are unlikely to face these challenges, but expect your own. Zoom will collapse 
sometimes, ‘events’ will turn plans upside down. The unexpected will happen; it 
is a good idea to expect it to.” (Podcast 2)
Anticipate Blow-ups
Blow-ups between members of the group will happen. Just live with them as 
part of the magic – even a necessary one. Don’t suppress them. They say groups 
form, storm, norm and perform. Think through how to clear the air after you 
have disagreed or agreed to disagree.
Unconditional Friends
My friend Jude Kelly and I first knew each other when she was a theatre direc-
tor. Now she is a UK activist on behalf of women, and always finds words that 
inspire me. As we set off, her advice to me was, “make a commitment from the 
outset, unconditionally, to be friends with each other. I have found it is really 
helpful if you just decide in advance that you will care for and love people and 
decide they are your friends, regardless of whether they irritate, annoy or even 
anger you.
50 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
“If you think about your long-standing friends, you sort of take them with 
all their idiosyncrasies and weirdness. It’s unconditional. It is how you create 
long term friendship. 
“When you are going into an Expedition like this, people are nervous, and 
they are territorial. It is much easier if you give away all of these things, as if 
everybody already was your long-term friend. Then, when they are irritating – 
and we all are sometimes – you can kind of just forget it. Get this right and you can 
carry on learning together for years.” (Podcast 12)
And then last tip from me: don’t forget; avoid job titles.
Your Expedition | 51
Journal
Solo
If your Expedition is solo, then who you are going to speak to becomes all the more 
crucial. Have a look at the list you made at the end of the last chapter. Assess it 
against the advice of the members from the First Expedition, and also assess it 
against what you know of yourself, so that you speak to people who lead in a very dif -
ferent way from you. Y ou want to speak to people from many different backgrounds, 
but also ask yourself if your list has people who simply think, speak, act and reason 
differently from you. Do they counterbalance you in their instincts: if you are a doer, 
are there enough thinkers, if you like order, are there enough people who thrive in the 
opposite, if you are quite serious, are there enough playful people on your list? 
Now think through how you are going to make sure that you keep exploring. 
There will be a constant temptation to draw together everything from this book and 
from the conversations you are having and land too fast on an approach to leading 
that resonates with you. But don’t succumb.
Get it into your mind that you are painting a picture, and first you must 
gather insights and materials and bring them back into your studio. Only once 
they are all gathered will you actually start painting. Or think of it as baking a 
cake. Y ou are gathering lots of ingredients and only once you have them all laid 
out in your kitchen will you start mixing. Every time you think you have enough 
ingredients, and you start to pull up your sleeves, stop, put down the new ingredi -
ents on the kitchen table and go back out there to find more. Only then will you be 
really exploring.
One last thought. Have you started writing and drawing in your journal? Or 
are you one of those people (like me) who said ‘yes, yes’ but privately thought you 
could do without one, that you would remember everything? I started my jour-
nal partway through the First Expedition and still regret the thoughts that have 
slipped away. 
52 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
As a Group
Make sure you simply enjoy each other when you all meet together for the first time. 
Don’t talk about families or careers, but instead about what you love doing or care 
about. 
T alk through how you are going to keep exploring, how you as a group will 
avoid the temptation to start painting or baking too soon.
Y ou may want to agree some conventions for how you will work together. Or 
you may not. 
Y ou might want to have your own ‘enabler’ and ‘disrupter’. The enabler 
watches for divides, comfortable for them to happen as a crucial part in the creative 
process and yet watching out in case they flip to destructive. The disrupter watches 
out for group think and for moments when sleeves are being pulled up too soon in 
preparation for baking.
| 53Your Map and Compass
Learning to lead has been a long journey for me, starting from rejecting the 
very concept, then eventually realising that my ambitions, if they were to be 
achieved, required me to lead. I then set out to assiduously observe people as 
they lead and steal from them what I thought would work for me. All the while 
I watched people around me to see what they required from their leaders. I was 
fascinated by how leaders brought about change and how they built up their 
own confidence so that they backed their own hunches. In my home life I was 
also trying to lead my increasingly large family, struggling with what people saw 
in me and what I saw in myself. 
All the time, I was collecting insights about leading almost like collect -
ing cards for my own eventual pack. It would be my personal collection. There 
would be no aces, kings or queens, no clubs or hearts, no sets or trumps, just my 
set of cards that together would frame how I lead. My first boss introduced me 
to an expression that stuck with me: “Y ou need to have your eyes on the hills 
and your feet on the ground.” So some of the cards were about the hills, how to 
keep my eyes on the big picture and tell stories about it so that everyone would 
see those same hills. And some of the cards were about keeping myself firmly 
rooted on the ground, because you can be as passionate and inspiring as you like 
about the hills, but you still have to run regular team meetings in such a way 
that colleagues would not miss one for the world. 
My journey has been long, and it is unfinished. More cards have been col -
lected over the last year on the First Expedition, ones that I wish I had had in 
54 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
my pack earlier. Looking back, I think it would also have been helpful to have 
had the map with me on my journey. 
Let me talk you through the three concentric circles with the infinity sign 
lying across them. 
Figure 1: the Four E’s
‘Essence’ is what makes us lead the way we do. ‘Elements’ are how our Essence 
shows up in our leading. ‘Expression’ is how our Essence and Elements play out 
in our leading. ‘Energy’ is what flows between the three, in both directions.
Best to start from the middle and work outwards. This makes sense be -
cause the first two circles are inward-facing, and from then on the map faces 
outwards. 
I am convinced that when the four E’s are disconnected it is harder, if not 
impossible, to lead effectively. Connected, the four E’s provide the basis for suc-
cessful leading.
Essence
If you google the word ‘Essence’ , it comes up as: “The intrinsic nature or indis-
pensable quality of something, especially something abstract, which determines 
its character.” Or, more fun, “ A strong liquid that is used to add a flavour or 
smell  to something.” I do like the thought that my Essence adds flavour and 
smell to my leading.
Your Map and Compass | 55
In the map, Essence is the central circle. It is, simply put, what makes us 
who we are, and specifically makes us lead the way we do. W e each have different 
pieces in our Essence, and they influence how we lead in different ways. 
On the First Expedition we found seven pieces that we felt we all had 
in different ways and in different proportions in our Essences, many of them 
deeply rooted in being women. The seven were: Motherness, Nature, the Body, 
the Sacred, Ancestors, T rauma and Education. W e offer these by way of illustra -
tion of Essence and as an invitation to consider the pieces of your Essence. Are 
some the same as ours? Are some others particular to you? 
I thought I was pretty clear about what made up my Essence at the start of 
the First Expedition and how this affected my leading, but I soon found myself 
out. An example was when Katrina spoke about the Body: it did not resonate at 
first, even remotely. I have always felt fat and I don’t like my body as a result, so 
I have always done my best to ignore it. But as Katrina spoke, I began to shift. 
She spoke about how we need to listen to our bodies when we are leading. And 
as she continued, Sarah began to nod energetically and then burst out, “I realise 
that I have been leading from my neck up all my life.” It was then that I got it. In 
the past, the Body would not have been a recognised piece of my Essence, but 
I can see it now.
The same thing happened with the word ‘motherness’ (a word we coined; 
I will explain later). I have always worried about using any variant of this word 
– motherhood or mothering – because not all women have biological children, 
so such words have felt excluding. I would not have named it as a piece of my 
Essence, even though I am deeply aware and proud of its impact on my leading. 
Then Aparna helped me: “W e don’t just mother our biological children, many 
of us mother other people’s children and we certainly mother the Earth.” So we 
looked for another word, and Motherness is now boldly and confidently at the 
centre of my Essence.
Please don’t forget that these seven pieces of Essence are only illustrations. 
Everyone will have different pieces in their Essence. Anna, I am absolutely cer -
tain, would have music as a piece of her Essence. In almost every discussion, 
56 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Anna brings in music, sharing and illustrating complex thoughts with musical 
parallels. Music would definitely be in Anna’s Essence, but sadly not in mine.
Elements
The next circle out from Essence is Elements. Elements are how your Essence 
shows up in how you lead. They are a messy and personal concoction, just as 
leading is a messy and personal concoction. It is silly to pretend that it isn’t. 
Inevitably, every piece of our Essence brings with it both light and shad -
ows, especially in its extremes. There will be some Elements which are unhelp -
ful. Y ou may have to consciously jettison them. Elements like the feeling that 
you are never enough or that you must always be the good girl that are rooted 
in your Essence.
There will be other Elements which you may choose to reframe. Y ou have 
probably perceived them as weaknesses for years but maybe, just maybe, they 
are quite the opposite and are in fact your strengths. Maybe the imposter syn -
drome is not a source of fear but rather a source of humility? Maybe instincts 
should not be dismissed as irrational but instead treated as early warning sys-
tems that kick in way before all that is rational does?
There is one Element you will need to really focus on: Purpose. It is the 
most significant Element that emanates from your Essence. What is your pur -
pose in leading? 
And then there are Elements that will need combining, even if they appear 
to be in contradiction or even in conflict. Like humility and visibility, being 
humble is not always about invisibility, and being visible is not always a display 
of absent humility. Both can and do – and must – live alongside each other 
when leading. Y ou could say the same about being both loud and quiet, being 
vulnerable and strong, and many more.
It feels important at this stage to remind ourselves again of how flawed 
words are. They are such inadequate and blunt ways to express ourselves, and yet 
we jump so fast to judge on the basis of them. They so often mean such different 
things to different people. Some are toxic and you use them unawares. Y ou can 
get lulled into thinking that you are speaking the same language as someone 
Your Map and Compass | 57
else, and then suddenly you blunder into using what is a trigger word for the 
other person. 
I expressed a nuanced thought recently and made the mistake of using the 
word “oxygen” to express it. It triggered a blow-up that took us way off course. I 
used the word as an alternative to attention, but I used it with an audience 
whose main experience of attracting attention is of attracting bigotry, and oxy -
gen is what they felt long deprived of. It triggered and I learned.
Sometimes it is not about using toxic words and it is simply an issue of 
translation. I remember asking all the members of the First Expedition to trans-
late the definition of leading that we had agreed on into their mother tongue. 
The word ‘catalytic’ caused chaos. It means so many different things to scientists 
and artists and to different people around the world. In some languages it even 
has completely the opposite meaning.
The moment I will not forget as we all struggled with translations was when 
Selvie gave me her first literal version into Bahasa. I innocently asked her if the 
translation was any good, and her answer was, “it’s accurate but it’s awful. It’s 
heavy and clunky and it stumbles.” It sounded awful even to me. So she started 
again with no attempt at a literal translation, and the result rolled eloquently off 
her tongue. She had a sense of pride that was visible as she spoke in her favourite 
language, just for a change. Is it a fair translation? I simply don’t know, but it 
looked like it might be, reading her face as she said it.
All this to say, change this map into the language that you enjoy speaking 
the most. T ake my words only as an invitation to find your own. After all, that’s 
what we did with Motherness.
So, the first two of the concentric circles, Essence and Elements, are both 
internally focused, and rightly, says Aparna: “W e should not fall into the trap 
of thinking that all the tools to lead are to be found in the external world. That 
would be to do ourselves a disservice. There is a wellspring that sits inside of 
us.” (Podcast 11)
But nor should we overdo this introspection. W e must also look outwards 
at the world we lead in. 
58 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Expression
Expression is the third of the concentric circles. It is about how our Essence and 
Elements play out as we lead.
Let us go back to that team meeting for an example of Expression. Leading 
a meeting is one of the most important tools for leading. Y ou must lead a meet -
ing in such a fashion that each individual member feels visible and included, 
makes their contribution, comes up with great ideas, listens to everyone, finds 
out what is going on, feels appreciated and challenged. Crucially, you need col -
leagues to leave clear, focused and inspired to get on with the work in hand and 
knowing why they are doing it. Y ou must lead the meeting so that as a team the 
whole is greater than the sum of the parts, ideas are noodled on and improved, 
plans are challenged and crystallised, culture is embedded and embodied, con -
flicts are aired and resolved, the team feels energised by being together. And 
do so in such a way that the work gets done, with the hurdles anticipated and 
overcome, the decisions made and implemented, the targets ready to be met 
and even exceeded. 
Like all leading, it requires you to address the needs of the individuals, the 
team and the task so that none of the three dominates. Otherwise, the individ -
uals may well be deeply inspired, but nothing gets done. The team is working 
beautifully together but on the wrong task. The task is being achieved but ev -
eryone is applying for a transfer. The team is strong and focused, but some in -
dividuals are being left out. The individuals feel motivated but are not working 
as a team.
Getting all this right is what Expression is about, the practical stuff of lead -
ing. The stuff of daily life when you start to lead.
Our Expedition uncovered people leading everywhere, and we went to 
find out what they do. Not how they are or what they believe, but what they 
actually do. Later in the book I have shared some extracts from my journal as 
examples of the conversations you need to have on your Expedition and the 
practical insights you are seeking. They are with people like Sylvia and Harriet 
Nayiga talking about midwifery, Allyson on leading in supply chain manage -
ment, Erin and Elsa sharing their stories of leading when the odds were hugely 
Your Map and Compass | 59
stacked against them, Kelly telling me about captaining a rugby team, Monica 
sharing how she approaches tough performance conversations without losing 
all sense of her Essence, Jennifer and Vivi leading creativity in their theatres. 
They are all women leading in totally different contexts, holding firmly onto 
their Essence as they work out how best to lead in the situation they faced in 
the real world. As you read about them here and speak to more women as part 
of your own Expedition, only pick up what you think will work for you because 
it will connect back through your Elements to your Essence.
Just before we go on to the fourth E, let us divert for a moment. T ake a 
step back to consider how connected and balanced the Essence, Elements and 
Expression circles are in you. 
Y our Circles
Consider the relative sizes and positions of the three circles for you. Here are 
three possible extremes.
Some of us have an enormous Expression circle. W e are practical, hands on, 
on the move, making things happen. In contrast, our Essence circle at the centre 
is very small. W e are not quite sure why we lead the way we lead. Maybe we don’t 
have the time or inclination to bother about it. 
I know successful and yet exhausted leaders who would put themselves in 
this category. They worry about their own sustainability. The connection be -
tween their Expression and Essence is loose and they are not quite sure about 
things. And sometimes it just cannot be revealed because they have to, at best, 
hide and, at worst, deny their Essence to succeed in the organisations or com -
munities in which they lead. 
Whatever the reason for the disconnect, they worry that their colleagues 
might spot it, possibly misunderstand it, and almost certainly mistrust it. As 
Katrina says, “you have to vocalise your Essence if people are going to trust you.” 
(Podcast 52)
60 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Figure 2: All Expression
Another extreme for some of us is that we have an enormous Essence circle. W e 
have really thought through and analysed ourselves and are very self-aware. In 
contrast, we have a relatively limited Expression circle. W e struggle to trans-
late our Essence into Expression. W e can see that nothing much is happening 
around us, but we cannot figure out how to breach the gap.
Figure 3: All Essence
The third extreme is when we have consciously or unconsciously disconnected 
Essence, Elements and Expression circles. W e do this either because we feel that 
Your Map and Compass | 61
we had to do so in order to succeed, or because we have not realised that women 
can lead in a way that works for us. Either way, we have adopted status quo lead -
ing and it has sometimes been successful, but we are certainly not bringing our 
diversity and freshness to the table. Mostly we are just adding to the group think.
Figure 4: Disconnected E’s
Uma tells me that the three E’s are perfect: “I love three. In Hinduism it is the 
strongest number. It is a symbol of brevity and rhythm.” But she says that she 
will have to accept the fourth E that lies across them because, “I love the infinity 
sign too. It is a very powerful symbol.”
Energy
Energy is an infinity sign that lies across the three circles and beyond, because 
there is a dynamic flow between them, a flow in both directions. 
The inner world of Essence flows out through Elements to Expression 
to frame how we do our leading. And the outside world flows back through 
Expression into Essence and causes us to question ourselves and evolve. The 
flow from in to out, and from out to in, is infinite. One anchoring everything 
that is built on it, the other making sure that Essence doesn’t get rigid and ossify.
This flow produces Energy: the Energy of leading. This is surely what lead -
ing really is: Energy. Think of the moment when a leader enters a room and the 
62 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Energy is sparked. Or think of when they have the opposite effect and drain the 
Energy.
Leading at its best generates Energy, space is created, atmosphere sparkles 
and things start to happen, often on their own with very little leading actually 
called for. The Energy starts to compound and so much more begins to feel 
possible. Then the Energy generated starts to spiral upwards, made ever more 
powerful because it is deeply anchored in Essence.
Figure 5: Energy spiral, anchored by Essence 
This book walks you through this map as you embark on your Expedition. W e 
share the pieces of Essence we uncovered on the First Expedition. Go through 
the Elements to jettison, reframe, find and combine. W e share the advice of 
many women as they express how they lead. And then we lift up to the infinity 
symbol and show how Energy is created, all the while avoiding the dead ends 
when it starts to be generated big time. 
But it all starts with Essence and motherness, that strange word that we 
coined and that I promised to explain.

Journal
Solo
Start working on your own map in your journal. Just have a go, a very rough first 
go. How big is each circle for you? Does one tend to dominate? Has this changed 
over time?
Ask people who know you well for a few words that capture how they observe 
you leading. What have they seen you do or not do, either well or not so well? Write 
down what they say. Then ask the same question to people who do not know you 
well, but have worked with you. Don’t complicate things by asking them to distin -
guish between Essence, Elements and Expression. That’s for you to do as you ask 
yourself questions like, “If I do that, where is it coming from?” And “If that’s in my 
Essence, why is it not coming out in how I lead?”
Think of moments when your Energy has been crucial to your success in lead-
ing, and when it hasn’t. Make a timeline of your journey of leading and plot out 
these moments.
Y our journal should be filling up now.
As a group
If you are exploring as a group, do all of the above individually and decide which 
bits to share and discuss. If you are a diverse group there are likely to be very differ-
ent and interesting insights. Listen hard to the differences and consider adjusting 
your own map as you do.
Once you have shared what you chose to share within your group, you could 
draw it all together by asking each of you to highlight something intriguing that 
another member of your group has written or said. Note: resist the temptation to 
just summarise your own thoughts.

Motherness
The word ‘motherness’ recognises the problems around words like ‘mother -
hood’ and ‘mothering’ . The first is that we do not want to exclude fathers. The 
answer surely is to value the beauty of ‘fatherness’ and recognise its undeniable 
overlaps with motherness. 
And the second being the exclusion of women who do not or choose not to 
have children. Aparna disentangled this one for me: “Mothering is so much more 
than giving birth. I know women who have never had children, who never wanted 
to have children, who are extremely maternal. Maybe it gives them the ability to 
be even more maternal, because they do not have the angst.” (Podcast 26)
But even with Aparna’s clarity, I still struggle with the traditional mother -
hood words, and so on the First Expedition we coined the word ‘motherness’ , 
which we felt was deeply rooted in all of our Essences, with a big impact on our 
leading. 
So how does motherness shape us as leaders? W e made a long, long list. 
A joyful and self-indulgent list. It is put together by birth mothers, adopting 
mothers, godmothers, women who mentor, mothers of communities and moth -
ers of nature.
Essence | 65
Organised
Rachel Middleton, a headhunter recently returned from maternity, has the 
freshness of a newcomer: “It sounds simplistic, but it is the truth. As a mother 
I have learnt to be organised and this has influenced how I lead. It’s especially 
important when you have people around you who rely on you.” (Podcast 46)
Kind
Rachel again: “Now I understand colleagues in a different way. I see the whole 
human being. Before, I might have fussed about someone being five minutes 
late for a meeting and drawn unkind conclusions. Now I am in this world of 
motherness where I am completely out of control 90% of the time. Things hap -
pen. I drop the ball, I make mistakes, I say the wrong thing and I realise nobody 
is exempt from ball dropping whether they are my team, my peers or my bosses. I 
have developed a degree of kindness as I see people as a whole person.” (Podcast 46)
Samia Latif, who leads in public health and has been learning from teen -
agers for some time, declares, “Y es, kind, and also I do not blame or shame any -
more. Because if you have teenage kids, you discover that it is the worst thing 
you can do. And this translates to work. When you debrief a difficult situa -
tion, you ask two questions: What went well and what could have gone better? 
Mothers get this right because they know how a culture of blame or shame is 
hugely detrimental.” (Podcast 47)
It took a while to persuade Melissa Kwee, a businesswoman and cam -
paigner in Singapore, to talk about her motherness. She kept on telling me that 
she did not have children of her own, but then she spoke about being a CEO 
during COVID: “Once a week we held a meeting where people could just drop 
in and check in. They did not need to turn on their camera, just drop in. I 
became known as the ‘hugging chief executive’ during COVID. That is what 
motherness is, isn’t it?” (Podcast 54)
66 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Boundaries
Myrna Atalla, who leads Alfanar, which invests in women social entrepreneurs 
in the Arab world, reflects back on the baby phase: “I finally learned that it is 
OK to have boundaries. I knew I needed them in theory; I had been on all the 
leadership programmes that told me to draw them, but it had not sunk in. Now 
I finally got it. In the first year I was actually turning off the notifications on my 
email because I found I would get home after a long day, during which I had 
been missing my child, and an email notification would come up. Even if I did 
not respond to the email, it sullied my time with my child. I realised that it is 
OK; I can pick up those emails later if I need to when I am in the right head -
space. Before, I would have responded to the emails instantly, feeling frantic 
and frustrated, and I would inevitably have responded incorrectly because I was 
in a rush.” (Podcast 46)
Bigger
Uthara Narayanan works with women in villages in the south of India. She 
talked about being a perfectionist, or rather about how motherness had cured 
her of perfectionism. She held high the adoption certificate for her son, signed 
by the Chief Registrar in Karnatake, as she told me the story: “W e were in an 
orphanage for something else and somehow it happened. He is severely differ -
ently abled. I started down a road that changed me as a person and as a leader. 
I am a perfectionist; I like things a certain way, I like things to be just right and 
I strive towards that. Suddenly, here is a child who does not have a so-called 
‘normal’ body structure, and he is not able to do things that others can do, but 
he is so happy. Just being around him every day changes how I lead. Nobody is 
perfect. W e just use our own abilities to the best that we can, and it is in your 
hands to find happiness.” (Podcast 64) 
Innovative
Back to Rachel, who has a glorious illustration of innovation in motherness: “I 
remember once with my son, he was crying and crying and crying. I just could 
not work out why he was crying. So I got in the shower with him. I didn’t turn 
Essence | 67
the shower on. I just stood underneath it. Then we got out. W e flushed the 
loo and he suddenly stopped crying. In moments like this, you are really, really 
tired. Y ou have tried everything. Y ou have gone through the list: he isn’t tired, 
or hungry, or ill, he doesn’t need burping or a clean nappy. Y ou just think, right, 
I have got to be creative. I have got to think of something new, something dif-
ferent. So you stand under the shower and flush the loo. And that is what was 
needed. 
“It is ridiculous, but actually it is that sort of innovation we need, partic-
ularly when the world seems to be crumbling down around us. W e just have to 
be calm, to rethink and reset, then come up with something new. I think that 
is probably the greatest thing I will take into my leading from motherness. If 
something is not working, don’t panic. Find a place of mental peace despite 
the screaming, calm yourself and just think of a new idea and try it. If it doesn’t 
work, start again. Some ideas do not work, but you have to try them, and if they 
didn’t work today, they might work tomorrow or they might work in two min -
utes’ time. There is nothing wrong with failing, even when you know the stakes 
are high. I mean mothering is the thing that you really do not want to fail at, 
but you fail at it all the time. Just pick yourself up and try it again, even if it is 
exactly the same thing. I guess that is what resilience is for leaders. That is what 
innovation is too: try new things and if they don’t work, try again tomorrow.” 
(Podcast 46)
When Melissa Kwee heard this story, she laughed and quoted her mother, 
saying: “Y ou know children never come with an instruction manual. Motherness 
is figuring out what to do without one.” (Podcast 54) 
It made me laugh too, because leading is the same, though I now think that 
a map does help.
Samia smiled too. She suspects that when Rachel has her second child, she 
will find that if she goes into the shower, it might not work. Samia says that is 
the other thing that motherness teaches you, that the people you lead are all 
very different: “Y ou have to get savvy enough to be able to say, ‘okay this is what 
works for this person, but it is a no-no for someone else’ .” (Podcast 47)
68 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Agile
For me, motherness made me better at spotting when to act and understanding 
the hazards of delaying or avoiding and the impact of compounding. Once my 
baby got into a state, I started to get into a state myself. Then the state started 
to accumulate and compound and things rapidly got out of control, and then 
everybody around me got into a state too. If I didn’t take the time out to spot 
what was going on early on, if I avoided and hoped and prevaricated, things got 
more out of control at an extraordinary speed. Most often it is because I was 
too tired to see what was happening or too distant to sense it. And by the time 
I acted, it needed a disproportionate effort to put it right. 
There is a direct link here to leading, having the instinct or judgement to 
hold back or get in there at the right time. If you let the wrong things run wild, 
they compound, and by the time it gets your attention it is massive. It’s also why, 
if you are leading, you have to be careful not to get too tired if you can possibly 
avoid it.
Consistent
Another big pull through from motherness to leading, for me, is consistency. 
T alk to anyone who fosters children, their top secret of success is: boring, in -
credibly boring, consistency. I learnt fast that my kids valued consistency, even 
when they were not crazy about what I was being consistent about. I learnt this 
with my first child and even more as I had more children. Of course, they are all 
very different, but I knew that I had to be consistent about the boundaries I set. 
Ok, I can sense my kids reading this. T om (the youngest) got away with 
far more, says Emma (the second eldest). T rue. But if anyone came to the house 
and any of you ignored them, you were sent straight to your room, weren’t you? 
Consistency is at the root of safety and of trust in both motherness and 
leading. T ry working for someone who changes the boundaries constantly, who 
moves the goalposts regularly, who responds to problems in completely unpre -
dictable ways, who has random favourites at random times, who switches from 
hot to cold almost in an instant, and quite inexplicably. Y ou will not thrive and, 
crucially, you are unlikely to trust them.
Essence | 69
Uncontrolling
Samia adds something more nuanced to our list: “Mothering teenage children 
forces you to rethink power and authority. Sometimes we feel we need to be in 
control, so as to stop disasters that we see unfolding from happening. But what 
I have realised is that we need to let them make their own mistakes. Leave them 
to walk on the path that they have chosen. W e can guide them, help them to 
navigate, but we cannot steer the way for them. They have got to do that them -
selves. Because then the lessons they learn are more meaningful. I try to take 
this lesson into my leading. T o give my team the autonomy to make decisions 
when I know full well that there is a risk, but then again there is risk in every -
thing. Things may not work out, but the learning does.
“Y ou learn fast that if you do intervene, it must be with lengthy explana -
tion and detailed background logic. I try to avoid it sometimes, to fob them off  
when I am really fed up, but it does not work. They need to know the reasons 
and the logic behind your intervention.” (Podcast 47)
Upskilling
Samia is on a roll now, this time on communication: “With children you realise 
how important regular check-ins are. Nothing fancy, just ‘are you ok? How was 
today?’ . Then they begin to feel safe. Don’t expect too much by way of reply in 
return; they will talk when they feel like talking.
“Kids also force you to upskill. For example, they use all of these emojis and 
slang and gifs. I ask my daughter what they mean. I’m constantly upskilling my 
communication because they use a totally different language that is very alien to 
me. But I know that I need to understand them to lead teams and read a room 
whether I am at work or at home.” (Podcast 47)
Modern
Samia pauses and smiles gently at this point. “I remember reading something 
very poignant by one of the companions of our prophet in Islam. His name is 
Ali; he went on to become one of the leaders of the Muslim Community after 
70 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
the prophet died. The saying goes, ‘Do not raise your children the way [your] 
parents raised you; they were born for a different time.’
“It has always stayed with me. The pressures that our children are facing are 
different, it is true of every generation. The environment we live in has changed 
rapidly. Our children see things through a very different lens. I think our lens 
gets very jaded; we see things the way they were when we grew up. W e get cata -
racts in our lenses. I think that is metaphorically true as our perspective on life 
becomes jaded. So how we lead needs that fresh influx and perspective. W e have 
to evolve. W e have to constantly check and recheck ourselves.” (Podcast 47) 
Vulnerable
This word had to be in this list. An ease with vulnerability comes hand in hand 
with motherness. It makes Saba Al Mubaslat, based in Egypt where she leads the 
Ford Foundation, laugh: “I remember how adamant I was on me being there to 
teach my kids. In fact, I rapidly realised that I was learning from them way more 
than I was teaching them: to be humble, to say I don’t know, just to be vulnera -
ble. They see the human side of me, that I am not a machine, that I get tired and 
do not want to talk and that sometimes it is me who wants space for myself. I 
did speeches for years about this stuff, but it was my kids who forced me to do 
it as a mother and now I do it when I am leading.” (Podcast 47)
To u g h
Saba wants to counterbalance some of the gentler words associated with moth -
erness with the tough ones too. “My son came home and said, ‘Mom, the exam 
did not go well today.’ I said, ‘okay, fine, we cannot change the result. W ere the 
questions you messed up on covered in the textbook?’ He nodded. ‘Why were 
you not able to answer them?’ His answer was, ‘we were not given enough time.’ 
It was clear that he thought it was all someone else’s responsibility. So I kept 
on probing until he owned his mistakes and learnt from them. I do not see any 
difference here from daily leading.”
Saba gave me another example: “Sometimes you have to put your heart 
aside. Y ou have to discipline. I invented a variation of the ‘naughty chair’ of my 
Essence | 71
childhood: I called it the ‘thinking corner.’ I would ask my boys to go and sit in 
it and think about their action, why it was not pleasant and what could be done 
to fix it. It used to break my heart seeing them sitting there with tears coming 
down. They were pleading, ‘I have not done anything wrong’ and I just kept to, 
‘take your time, think about it.’ I told myself that at least it was a paradigm shift  
from the ‘naughty chair.’ I cannot remember the number of times I just wanted 
to run to them and hug them. But they needed to know that they were perfectly 
loved and that the imperfect action could be fixed. It is the same when you are 
leading. Y ou have to be clear and consistent about what is not acceptable, what 
must be done better, what can be done better with reflection. T o go away and re -
think a proposal or whatever you are working on and then discuss it tomorrow. 
I try to nudge colleagues not to allow themselves to do a mediocre job, if for no 
other reason than that I know they can do better.” (Podcast 47)
W e talked about all the words associated with mothers. T ough is seldom 
on the list. But it should be.
Nurturing
Saba then went in another direction: “I think the only way to lead with love and 
care is to behave as if you are stuck with your team forever, like your kids. Y ou 
may reach a point where it is not working, and you must let go, but even then, 
the mentoring and support you have provided will stay with them forever. Y ou 
have to take responsibility for being part of their journey. Whatever good or 
bad you leave them with might affect them for the rest of their journey. I take it 
very personally when I fail to help one of my team members to flourish.” 
I asked Saba if she ever takes too much of those mothering skills into work. 
Her answer was yes, but she drew a distinction: “With my boys I try to be lov -
ing, fair and firm. With my colleagues I try to be fair and firm with love. The 
order of the words matters a lot because I am leading professional adults who 
are responsible for their own behaviour. Y ou can care, but over caring can hin -
der their ability to grow.” (Podcast 47)
72 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Visibility
Anna explained this concept of visibility to me with a story told her by a friend 
who played in an orchestra with Maestro Bernard Haitink as the conductor: 
“There is a small cello solo in the Alpine symphony. The principal cellist played 
it. Bernard stopped and said, ‘it was very beautiful, but maybe a touch less vi-
brato?’ She played again and he stopped again, looked at his score, then put his 
hand on his heart with a sad expression on his face and said, ‘I am so sorry; I 
do not have the words to describe what it is I am asking from you. Can we do 
it again?’ And the third time was just sublime. It was completely transformed.
“By thanking her and not coming down on her and by appealing to her 
musicality, the maestro had lifted her. She was visible and liberated to have her 
own idea about the music. So she tried again and found something else which 
was exactly what he wanted. He transformed her way of playing just by giving 
her visibility and the permission to try something herself.” 
Anna believes passionately that great leading makes everyone feel visible. 
Even if they are one in a vast orchestra and only have a tiny note to play. Even, 
in Anna’s case, if you are the second violin in a sea of violins.
It is important to say that Anna carefully distinguishes visibility from ex -
posure. “Leading well makes people feel visible without feeling exposed and 
without making them feel that they need to expose themselves to be visible.”
Anna believes that motherness inspires us to give this gift of visibility. T o 
see others and not just ourselves. And that the best leading does this too. 
Enabling
Melissa is convinced that, “Motherness somehow creates an enabling environ -
ment. One that is sometimes supportive and sometimes quite challenging, but 
even in the challenge there is a foundation to build on. This environment en -
ables people to thrive. I feel like that is a huge part of leading, creating the con -
ditions in which people find it within themselves to take action.”
When I asked Melissa to give me an example, she was still pushing back on 
the basis that she never had biological children. I replied to her, “Y ou expressed 
your motherness to us all, all the way through the First Expedition.” And so she 
Essence | 73
began to talk about the community where she lives in Queenstown, Singapore: 
“It is a mixed income neighbourhood where people do not necessarily connect, 
where there is not a great care for the public spaces or a strong connection to 
place or to each other. When I moved there, I started opening my house, listen -
ing to my neighbours about what they loved about the neighbourhood, finding 
ways in which their interests and talents could be shared. W e have slowly built 
the community.” 
Now it is not just Melissa running activities and programmes in her home, 
it is also the many neighbours who until then had lived there for decades not 
knowing one another and never saying a word to each other. Melissa explained: 
“Now, if my neighbour loves to cook and he is only able to have a job two days 
a week, people are ordering from him, and we have got a little catering business 
going. It is birthing possibilities through just creating the space where people’s 
gifts and talents are discovered and shared. There is a lot of sitting, eating and 
laughing around a table. It is about creating the conditions for others to find 
their voice.”  
I asked Melissa how important food is to motherness. She said it was essen -
tial. She described her kitchen as a “W ar Ready Pantry” (Podcast 54) and I can 
visualise it because she created a mini one when we met together at the end of 
the First Expedition. W e kept asking “where is Melissa?” The answer was always 
that she was at the local supermarket buying more food for us “just in case we 
got hungry.” Her bottles and packets filled the shelves in the tiny kitchen. When 
we left it was a joy handing them on to the women who came to prepare for the 
next guests. 
Less ego
Melissa also put her finger on a final light that emanates out of motherness, one 
that she has already illustrated: much less ego. I asked her what would happen 
if she left Queenstown.
“I do not plan to leave but I do not believe that community can or should 
ever be built around a single person. So the most important thing is raising up 
a core with common values and a common sense of what we want to see in our 
74 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
neighbourhood and ensuring that we are constantly bringing in new and dif-
ferent people. I don’t actually show up every Saturday now. It never should be 
about a single person. It is motherness, isn’t it: built-in redundancy? Or built in 
evolution, letting the chicks fly.” (Podcast 54)
That completes the list we put together. I am sure there are many more from 
Rachel, Samia, Myrna, Uthara, Melissa, Anna, Princess and Saba. Motherness 
is undoubtedly in our Essence and has had a significant impact on our leading. 
Melissa Kwee describes it as: “a set of life-giving attributes which focus in -
tently on the well-being and thriving of another.”  But she recognises that, as 
with every piece of our Essence, there comes both light and shadows, and moth -
erness is no exception to this.
Shadows
I asked Melissa about the shadows of motherness and how they translate to 
leading. Here are three from her:
The first is ‘smother-hood’: “It is being overly present, overly concerned, 
overly cautious, overly interventionist. It is when the unbridled gifts of empathy 
and care overwhelm others with their singularly focused emotion and action. It 
is a dead end for motherness and also for leading.”
Everyone needs fresh air and space to breathe, rather than a tornado of 
concern and remedies. Smotherness can repel and disempower people. Melissa 
is clear: “The leader who draws smotherness into their leading prevents them -
selves from raising others to discover their own agency and become their high -
est selves.”
Princess Ashilokun, a young poet and rapper whom I admire, reflected on 
this and put it into her context: “Mothers want to protect their daughters and 
inadvertently pass on a sort of cage mentality, so that even before we experience 
the things which caged our mothers, their mentality shapes us to fit into those 
cages. It becomes a repeating cycle.
“Y our mother is telling you that there are certain ways in which a woman 
can – or rather a wife must – exist. If you do not conform to these things, then 
there is going to be ‘wahala’ – the Nigerian term for trouble. What she does not 
Essence | 75
realise is that she is taking away your childhood and autonomy, your ability to 
figure out for yourself who you are. She is trying to shape your existence to con -
form to the idea of a husband who does not even exist yet but whose existence 
already shapes your being. She is trying to save you rather than allowing you to 
save yourself.” 
Back to Melissa’s shadow. It is ‘mini-me’: mothers with unmet needs, un -
fulfilled dreams and an inability to let go end up trying to create mini-me’s. 
Melissa observes that, “Motherness can unconsciously slip into this trap when 
emotional closeness is exchanged for mirrored action. And it translates to lead -
ing in a way that does not create space for the beauty and strength of each indi-
vidual to be seen, felt and nurtured.”
The third shadow is ‘respect your mother’: Princess jumped when I uttered 
these words of Melissa’s. She began to talk about the hierarchies in families and 
took over describing this third shadow in motherness: “It is a motherness that 
demands respect even when it is wrong. Blind respect. Blind obedient respect. 
It comes from when the lines are blurred between respect and deference.”  
The result is that for the people you mother or the colleagues you lead, 
being respectful becomes prided above autonomy and sense of self. Princess 
kept going: “I am having flashbacks to those moments that prevent girls from 
speaking up because they are thinking about being respectful. It is the saddest 
of things because it shows you that your mother’s beliefs are already entrenched. 
She has accepted the cage and is passing it on. She is now, inadvertently or not, 
shaping you to fit into it. As we try to change society and patriarchal structures, 
we have to remember not to become too much like our mothers.”
W e have all watched leaders obsessed with hierarchy, who demand respect 
and in the same breath demand that colleagues speak up. T alking to Princess, I 
was reminded of Andini’s words about The Devil W ears Prada and grasped the 
full damage that film did to ideas of women leading. Sadly, the Devil still seems 
to wear Prada.
Smotherness, mini-me, respect your mother; I am sure there are more. 
They all translate from motherness into leading, and we see them everywhere. 
76 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
As I write these, I see little glimpses of me, and it hurts. I recognise how 
some of the shadowy sides of my Essence have translated into how I am as a 
mother and my leading, and that hurts too. 
Hiding motherness
I know that many women choose to keep clear dividing lines in their lives and 
would rather separate motherness and leading, but I hope it is their decision to 
do so and not the result of pressure to do so. 
Going back to Rachel: “Motherness is a rollercoaster.” At this point she 
was muttering, “motherness, or whatever you want to call it, Mum.” She was 
irritated by the cumbersome word and felt entitled to say so. Y es, I must admit 
it, Rachel is indeed my daughter, and the screaming baby in the shower is my 
grandson. 
“I feel that this experience has changed me more than any experience that 
I have had in my whole life, and I think that needs to be a bit more celebrated.
“It is so important that you can bring the learning with you when you re -
turn to work, because it will have changed you dramatically and wholeheartedly 
as a human and as a leader. If captured and acknowledged in the right way in 
the workplace, I think it can be completely transformative. But if it has to be 
concealed, or if you have to be ashamed of it, then I think it can do quite the 
opposite to your leading. It can lead to you losing confidence or empathy. Y ou 
might end up putting loads of effort into trying to conceal a part of you that 
is quite dramatically different to what you were before you left.” (Podcast 46)
Celebrated would be great, even acknowledged would be a move in the 
right direction. It is not always easy to do so because we risk being written off as 
weak or wrong, or patronised for our newly acquired ‘soft skills’ . 
Rachel ends with a plea: “I don’t think there are many women who, when 
asked, ‘has motherhood transformed you as a leader?’ would reply that it had. I 
have not heard of many apart from you.” (Podcast 46) 
Rachel has seen me do this in every speech I have made since I had my first 
child. I promised myself then that I would always tell some motherness stories 
Essence | 77
when I spoke about leading. But Rachel has also seen how half the audience 
delighted in them, while the rest wrote me off as unprofessional.
Aparna pulls this together: “I feel like to be a maternal leader is so incredi-
bly powerful in whatever context it is performed. Why would we not allow that 
side of ourselves to emerge in a world where there is so much conflict?
 “I have this huge dream that one day we’re going to have women leading 
everywhere. And especially in interfaith dialogue, because we have so much re -
ligious conflict in this world, and I cannot imagine not needing an element of 
motherness in it.” (Podcast 26) 
T wo last thoughts from me:
I think that getting good at leading helps you to get good at motherness, 
too. It works both ways. It certainly has for me. 
It works both ways with nature too. If we use our motherness in caring for 
nature, I think nature will care for us too. 
So we move on to nature as the second piece of the Essence discovered by 
the members of the First Expedition.
78 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Nature
Nature is surely another piece in our Essence, though I am not sure that we are 
all conscious of it and its impact on how we lead. It cannot be a coincidence that 
we express ourselves through nature so often. 
The Baobab 
Priyanka sees nature through a Botswanan lens where, for her, nature is the start 
and end of everything: “Nature is everywhere you look and when you start to 
look at it you have to see things differently. W e have this deep rootedness to our 
soil, the soil of Botswana. W e have got the most stunning Baobab trees, they 
are called the tree of life because so much comes out of them that is nurturing; 
from food to medicine.
“I think the more time I spend in nature, the more I start to look at myself 
differently and at how I lead. I learn about flexibility, resilience, about the per -
manence and unpredictability of change. About what actually grows when you 
give it the right environment. And most of what I see goes against what I have 
been taught. 
“One of my favourite things is the Botswana sky. When I look up to the 
sky, I think of an expression used by the poet, Rumi: ‘Even after all this time, 
the sun never says to the Earth, “look at me, you owe me” .’ I think that is what 
we must do, light people up. It is what I have learnt to do by spending time in 
nature in Botswana.” (Podcast 24)
The vā
Sina W endt, originally from Samoa in the South Pacific before becoming a busi-
ness leader in New Zealand, speaks of the Vā – or rather of its absence: “W e talk 
about the Vā which, translated to English, literally just means ‘the space’ . Most 
Polynesian societies see space as a relational space, not a physical space. It is a 
sacred space that connects us, not just to other humans but to the environment 
and to the ecology of the world. In Samoa we believe it to be our duty to be in 
Essence | 79
a collective, to be in relationship with each other and to nourish and nurture 
and cherish the Vā. 
“During COVID we realised how bad the Vā had become. It felt like the 
planet had said ‘enough is enough. Look at the way humans have treated our 
planet, look at the way humans have treated each other.’ It is not that the Vā 
was that good before, but the isolation of COVID magnified how empty it had 
become.
“I suppose to create a different Vā we have to have a better idea of what it 
is we want to create together, and that is the biggest challenge. That is where I 
get completely frustrated and sad and angry. I look at the way people who lead 
in different parts of the world come at it with what I consider to be a really 
W estern mindset. It is kind of a ‘last person standing’ mindset. If we continue 
to see things through this lens we will get nowhere.” 
The Vā is a beautiful expression that I must introduce to Fatima Zibouh 
in Bruxelles. She spends her life bringing women together in the city, and de -
scribes it as, “building bridges to connect up islands in an archipelago, but in a 
culture where you only get recognised if you are leading an island.”
Nature seems to very naturally sit in our Essence and play out in how we 
lead in beautiful ways.
Not all light
W e often use beautiful words to capture nature’s impact on us, such as serenity 
and wisdom, yet, as Ana Luz says, “it too has its shadowy sides which curiously 
might prepare us well for the tough realities of leading.
“I have always felt a deep connection to nature, but it is not what I would 
call a spiritual one, an interconnectivity, a Oneness with nature and an under -
standing of its complexity. 
 “I like to say that I have travelled the journey as a scientist from trying 
to understand nature when I was doing pure research, to looking to conserve  
nature. And now, two decades later, to really focusing on our relationship with 
nature: sustaining it and ourselves. 
80 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
“I think that women have a special way of connecting to nature. W e are 
more cyclical beings and many of us feel deeply connected to nature in a way 
that is restorative. But I worry when people become over-emotional and start to 
romanticise nature and assume that it is inherently good, because we risk forget -
ting how very powerful and very destructive nature can be. Y ou may romanticise 
the lion cub but if you go on a safari and you watch the lions hunt, it is a brutal 
business. W e must approach nature with a certain reverence, recognise there are 
mysterious ways of functioning that we might not ever fully understand, and 
take on board its nuances and complexities.”
For Ana Luz, nature being central to her Essence has had a profound im -
pact on how she leads, both from the light and the shadowy sides. 
“Y ou start to understand that there are different ways of leading at different 
times because there are cycles, and there are cycles within cycles, as in nature. It 
has an acceptance of cycles, of death and destruction. There are also seasons; it 
is not always about grow, move forward, produce progress, generate more inces-
santly. There is this sense of enoughness in nature. And nature makes you pay 
more attention because you do not know exactly what is coming next. It can be 
unpredictable, deeply uncaring and unfair. So we cannot assume a stable world. 
Change is the norm today and it will be the norm for the rest of our lives.
“If you hold on to nature in your Essence, you avoid the trap of the dreamy 
quality in leading. Y ou recognise and anticipate that the world is not always be -
nevolent however much, as women, you have a desire to see more benevolence. 
It means that you are not surprised when the hard realities of leading actually 
hit you, nor are you unprepared when the system is unfair. When I was younger, 
it hurt me when I found colleagues in positions of power who were unkind and 
unpredictable. It was a shock, but I have learnt to navigate around these and to 
adapt. Much like nature does.
“ And yet I think the greatest impact that it has on my leading is this sense 
of harmony that we see in nature; this deep sense of gratitude for sustenance 
and all of those things that sunlight brings.” (Podcast 53)
I asked Ana Luz if another impact was linked to the expression ‘the infinite 
game, ’ which she once explained to me. 
Essence | 81
“The idea is that we are here playing an infinite game. It is not a finite game. 
W e are not here to win or lose. When we play an infinite game, the goal is to 
keep playing, not to end the game.
“If victory is to keep playing, it means we have to do things differently. W e 
have to collaborate. W e have to figure out what the next step is together because 
if we just eliminate the other player, the game is over. W e have to be inclusive 
because everyone is part of the ecosystem that needs balancing. In real life we 
are mainly surrounded by finite games; sports that have rigid, unchanging rules, 
tight timings, most of them are competitive, most of them have winners or los-
ers. The infinite game gives you a different way of looking at how we are doing 
as a society, as human beings, as Earthlings.” (Podcast 53)
As Ana Luz spoke, I remembered a podcast episode with Sarah and Paula. 
Sarah the social entrepreneur was reflecting with Paula V accaro, a film pro -
ducer, on The Hunger Games series (Podcast 17). It is an example of the ulti-
mate finite game, designed quite cynically to pit people against each other. Ana 
Luz laughed. “That happens in nature too. I mean, resources are finite. Nature 
teaches us that. Sometimes we go into a meeting and see it is a finite game. 
Whether we like it or not, only one of us will emerge winning. It is a reality, but 
it is important to remember that ultimately it is an infinite game.” I asked Ana 
Luz for an example. “It means that sometimes you pass on an opportunity be -
cause you don’t think you are the best person to deliver it. By doing this you are 
nurturing the ecosystem.” I asked her if she has even been written off as a weak 
female leader when she did this. Her answer: “I think there is a risk of that, yes. 
A risk you just live with.” (Podcast 53)
Generational 
Our commitment to nature makes us deeply focused on the issues of climate 
change. In many parts of the world, these issues are dividing women into gener -
ations. Without any doubt it is a dominant piece in young women’s Essence – as 
is the trauma it generates.
Hila Davies, a young student from the Philippines and passionate volun -
teer for T ake Action Global, says, “I feel like the climate crisis has been dumped 
82 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
on our generation. As young women we feel that it has taken over our entire 
lives and is causing serious climate anxiety. Y oung people do not have agency. 
People like Greta Thunberg have been given a platform, but there is no point 
getting to the table if it is to fill a quota or to allow the inviters to claim, ‘look, 
we’re listening to young women’ if it is just for show on social media. Y oung 
women specifically are the butt of jokes. Every single thing that a teenage girl 
gets caricatured and nit-picked by the media, by the existing leaders and also 
by older women. There was one campaign called the ‘VSCO girl’; she was be -
ing ridiculed, amongst other things, for using plastic straws. It became a joke, 
everyone imitated VSCO girls. It is so sad to see important issues dismissed. 
They only seem to become important when they come out of the right mouth, 
because a young woman’s voice is heard as her being angry or bossy, or a social 
justice warrior. Whatever you do, you always feel powerless. 
“Think of the ‘seat at the table’ idea. It is almost like someone has pulled up 
a chair for you, you have sat down and now you witness what is going on. It is 
happening in front of your eyes, all the dominoes are toppling, there are flash -
ing lights focused on the things that you cannot control, but no one has asked 
you to speak. Y ou are just sitting there, silently, like you have a piece of tape 
over your mouth. It is morbid, you see everything, but you can do nothing. Not 
because you do not want to, but because no one has given you the platform or, if 
they have, it is like you are speaking into a mask. Y ou are speaking into nothing, 
everyone’s nodding and agreeing but they are not going to do anything. 
“Ever since I was little it was my goal to be a mother. I was like the kid 
who was always playing with baby dolls. But in the last couple years, I question 
whether I should.
“I want to ask for help. As young women we feel we are facing this on our 
own, in the middle of the tornado. W e need older women to help to stand be -
hind us. T o use their voices to help amplify ours. W e have got that seat at the 
table, but we need generations of women behind us holding that seat down and 
making sure that we stay in place. Then we will rip the tape off young women’s 
mouths and speak.”
Essence | 83
I hope that the many generations who have nature firmly in their Essence 
either because they choose to care for or to fight on behalf of nature will come 
together and not let this divide us. 
T o me, it is on us older women to breach this divide, to stand aside when 
needed and hand some of our power on to the next generation and then watch 
their backs as they use it. On this issue of nature and climate change there is 
an overwhelming urgency to do this. I don’t mean abdicating all responsibility 
and declaring, “it’s over to the next generation now, ” that is not leading. I mean 
working together; that is leading. After all, nature is almost certainly in all of 
our Essences to a greater or lesser extent.
84 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
The Body
Alison Coburn, with whom I worked for over thirty-five years at Common 
Purpose, loves yoga. I have always had a theory that our longevity as friends 
is rooted in her yoga. When I drove her mad, yoga helped her. She has always 
balanced body and mind with an elegance I could only dream of, one that yoga 
seemed to be at the heart of. “Y ou imagine yourself riding two horses, body and 
mind; you are trying to get them to work in harmony. When you are leading it is 
the same, though we sometimes feel we are riding more than two horses, maybe 
four or five.” (Podcast 19)
Right through the First Expedition, women talked about the body: of 
reaching the right relationship with it, of challenging notions of ‘mind over 
body’ , of getting to a place of connection rather than control, of the cycles of na -
ture that weave into the cycles of women’s bodies, and of how all of this frames 
our leading. 
Placing body into my Essence did not come naturally to me, and I have 
slowly realised that it’s not just refusing to love my body because it is not perfect. 
It is also being the mother of my middle daughter Kate who has an autoimmune 
disease called lupus. It’s her lupus and not mine, but fifteen years of trying to 
get my motherness right, of avoiding what Melissa would call ‘smotherness’ so 
that I can help her, has had a deep impact on me. It’s the nature of autoimmune 
conditions that has deepened my distance with my body. I will let Kate explain: 
“Seven percent of the population have autoimmune diseases. They are invisible, 
they strike in the mid-twenties and are mostly incurable. There are eighty of 
them; some, like MS, diabetes and Crohn’s, are more well-known than others. 
Something triggers your body and your immune system starts attacking itself. 
So your body becomes your worst enemy.” It’s the attacking that has got to me. 
Kate started a gloriously successful charity called The W ren Project to address 
head on the psychological problems caused by this happening. My response has 
been less admirable; I have trusted ‘the body’ even less.
But Aparna, Katrina, Martyna and Anna have managed to place body into 
my Essence, taking in the light and not just its shadows, and Alison will be de -
lighted to hear that I have finally got there.
Essence | 85
Aparna went first: “For years, I have struggled with the unwritten and con -
ditioned response, where we turn to the intellect to solve and resolve problems. 
I am asked to overcome what I ‘feel’ in my body, to accept the pressure to be ob -
jective and to value rationality above all else. Meanwhile, I inhabit the body of 
a woman, a body that is continually expressing intelligence in ways that appear 
to be far beyond my control, a body that responds to its natural environment 
and generates its own rhythm, its own clarity on when to rise up and when to 
sink down. T o listen to its wisdom I do not need language, I do not need to 
think, I have to allow myself to simply be. Because our bodies and minds are 
inextricably linked.
“By centring the body, I am also pushing myself towards a ‘non-W estern’ 
view of leadership – one that values instinct, mystery and nature over reason, 
knowledge and technology. I am experimenting by leading with the wisdom of 
the body rather than simply the information in my mind.” 
Katrina picked up from here as she spoke of her relationship with her body 
and her journey as a Paralympian: “Now I look at my own body as having the 
gift of Cerebral Palsy. My left side is my able side, so I understand what it feels 
like to be able. What a gift. My right side has my cerebral palsy. It is where things 
do not work. I have this understanding of when people cannot do things or do 
things in a different way. Another gift. I have grown into this understanding. 
I wrote a letter to myself twenty years ago. I had tears in my eyes, and I wrote 
the words ‘what a gift’ . I have been born in a body that understands both lives. 
I physically cannot curl my toes on my right, and I never will. But I can do it so 
easily on my left. It is almost too easy. And that fascinates me; in this one body 
how easy something can be and how hard something else can be.” (Podcast 52)
A barometer
Katrina is convinced that the body is the Essence of all Essences, the primary 
Essence. She talks about it as her ‘barometer.’ 
“ As an athlete, the mental, emotional and spiritual parts are crucial, but 
the physical body for me has been something I have learned to really master and 
listen to. I don’t just rely on the intellectual component.
86 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
“I listen to my body as it sends me messages all the time. I have to listen 
hard to hear them. The message may be about re-energising, telling me to go 
for a run or to lay on the floor to be still. Or the message might be about being 
triggered, that I am now feeling emotional and need to go for a walk quietly on 
my own. 
“It happened when we were together at the end of our First Expedition. 
One of our discussions triggered something in me, so I went for a walk in the 
dark. I didn’t care about walking away; I just knew I had to dissipate that Energy 
from a physical point of view so I could come back and have more wonderful 
conversations.  
“ A big part of leading and understanding yourself is having a strong sense of 
what your body needs. Only then will you have that ability to understand oth -
ers’ needs. T o judge when to step in and when to be quiet. I love the infinity sign 
that we have lain across our three E’s. It’s about fluidity, knowing when to come 
in and when to come out. The infinity symbol opens a flow of Energy that goes 
from you to me, then back to you, and then back again to me. But remember it 
is physical as well as emotional. 
“Think about what happens when you are in a room. What is the Energy 
exchange? And what happens when you leave it? What are you leaving behind? 
And what about other people? As we lead, we do so often forget to watch the 
physical in other people. W e are intellectual and spend a lot of time in our heads 
and maybe have not found that connection to the physical yet.” (Podcast 52)
I asked Katrina about the balancing act. What happens when you go in 
the opposite direction and let the physical dominate? “I certainly realised com -
ing from sport that you could not pile everything on just the physical. At the 
Sydney Paralympics, I got out there and I lost. I only won one silver and one 
bronze in Sydney. And I did not even run a personal best. 
“ After those games, I sat down with my psychologist coach because I felt 
like I had failed. W e unpacked how my life was then. I was saying yes to every 
opportunity that came my way. W e looked at everything that I had on my plate 
leading into the Sydney Paralympic Games and we said, ‘there is no way I could 
have won a gold medal, there is no way I could have done a personal best because 
Essence | 87
I had too many competing agendas in my head, so I was performing at a silver or 
worse level in every aspect of my life.’ So I made some significant changes and 
got a gold in 2004 in Athens. It was extraordinary. From then on, I knew that I 
needed checks and balances in place. Because I can easily go back to that default 
of having too much on my plate and ignoring my body’s messages and thinking I 
can do everything and be Superwoman. And I just cannot.” (Podcast 11)
A prop
Martyna Pastuszka, the conductor of a Polish orchestra, talks about the role of 
the body in leading not as a barometer but almost as a prop. She gave the most 
eloquent of examples, beautifully illustrating that it was so much more power -
ful as a conductor to invite an orchestra to play and do so with the body. No tap -
ping on a lectern or a loud clearing of the throat for Martyna, instead a gesture. 
“I know the power of a gesture. Y ou can say so many things just by the 
way you look or by the position of the chin. Y ou can be proud and unbeatable 
because your chin is slightly higher. And then you can be modest because you 
put it lower. Y ou can inspire someone else by this beautiful suggestion while not 
taking away any freedom of interpretation. Y ou only suggest with your body, so 
players can then give what they want. I think that we should use much more 
our body.”
Martyna talked to me about a wedding she attended when she saw that, 
“dancers can dance together without speaking. If you dance with an old aunt 
or uncle, you actually synchronise much faster than some of the players in the 
orchestra can. W e should learn from wedding dances to adjust quickly using our 
bodies; as the tempo of the dance changes, our steps to each other adjust. W e 
take care because we suddenly remember that this is the elderly aunt who has 
a problem with her right hand, so we should not press it too much. All these 
things, the sensitivity and the intuition, they play a huge role because you can -
not talk. The dance music is far too loud for talking.
“When you are leading you use your body to have influence, only with 
a suggestion so that you do not take away the freedom of the people you are 
leading. Freedom is something musicians and artists value a lot. Most people 
88 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
do. They do not want to lose their individuality. And that’s why it is best to 
suggest but not to instruct or to force. And do not forget to smile. The troubles 
are never so big that you cannot smile. And move your hands so that they are 
embracing. I think about how to lead without verbalising.” (Podcast 45)
It was Anna who introduced me to Martyna; she had never played for 
Martyna, but she had seen how physical Martyna’s conducting was. Observing 
it was a breakthrough for Anna.
Sarah made the same breakthrough when she heard Anna play when we 
met at the end of the First Expedition: “I had thought that my head controlled 
my body until I heard her music. I realised my body actually deeply controlled 
my thinking. I saw ways to express myself without saying a single word, I discov -
ered gestures that are more powerful than all of the words that I will ever string 
together” . (Podcast 49). 
Anna discovered gestures from Martyna, and another breakthrough came 
from another conductor she once played for. “He said to me, ‘allow your body 
to smile.’ I was in the first year of my studies and I was very serious and am -
bitious. It transformed my playing and there was a big change in the room.” 
(Podcast 45)
Smiling is such a big message from the body, a glorious generator of Energy 
and hope. When I first met Ani, not a conductor but a nun, not in Poland but 
in Nepal, smiling was all she did. “Smiling is one of the healthiest things to do, 
and singing and dancing as well. Some people think that serious people should 
not do this. Or they think they are going to be powerful so they have to be 
strong and boring. Boring and unemotional. I do not consider a person who is 
boring to be leading well. Not so inspiring.” 
I told Ani that my father described people he did not trust as “smiling with 
everything except their eyes.” Ani laughed. “Y ou can also have sparkling eyes 
without actually stretching your lips. I see it often. Y ou need to let your face tell 
the story. I like to be comfortable, I like to be happy. I like to be joyful and if it 
is too rigid and too constrained, I feel suffocated. And if you have a very suffo -
cated face and attitude, you cannot inspire or lead anyone.” 
Essence | 89
Ani had just returned from a shopping trip to buy “silly, pretty shoes” for 
one of her young colleagues. “She is a young lady and I know her desire to look 
pretty and attractive. So I fulfilled her wish. And then I can sense how happy 
she was, and I got that happiness transmitted to me. See how smart I am?
“I make sure that I do not feel stingy about giving a smile. It can be very 
infectious. Somebody will definitely smile at you. But only when they see a true 
smile, not a plastic smile, a robotic smile.” She added, “The stock of joy in your 
heart through your smile will increase more and more. The more you give, the 
more it will increase.” (Podcast 18)
Three insights
I cannot finish talking about the body without sharing three entirely random 
insights.
First from Martyna, she gave me a tip about stretching. She shared it be -
cause I asked her about how she copes when she stands up on stage knowing 
that thousands of eyes are focused on her. Her advice: “Stretch your legs and 
just stand like the guard. Think of guards on borders. They stand in a special 
way, this stretched position of the shoulders and of the hips. It actually makes 
you produce more testosterone than cortisol. That is what men do as they go on 
the stage. I see girls trying to be so small, almost trying to shrink, shoulders so 
close and the legs crossed, making themselves so tiny. My advice is stand like a 
guard. It will help with your breathing too.” (Podcast 45)
The second from Liz Bloomfield, whose career has spanned the army, the 
corporate world and now film making. Hers came as a warning, one that made 
me think hard: “W e must find effective ways to project our strength without re -
lying on physical or verbal dominance.” Physical made total sense. I think of the 
huge men who have peered down at me, consciously intimidating, so that I end 
up on my tiptoes, poking my finger at them. But verbal made me step back. It 
brought to mind the people who talk without drawing breath and repeat louder 
when people do not get a point on first hearing. Their voices eloquent and dom -
inant, their speech firing out, using words some of us need to google. They often 
do this even when they are wrong and know that they are. Back to Liz: “Because 
90 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
the result of leading based on physical and verbal dominance is people getting 
more and more passive and less engaged, as they drop their creativity in order 
to follow instructions.”  
The third of the random insights on the body before we move on is very 
beautiful, and came in the form of a powerful challenge from Katrina: “W e 
see someone and then judge in an instant if this person is a threat or a danger. 
Sometimes we meet people who have the gift of expressing a warmth and em -
pathy from the start which helps people trust them or value their competency. 
I think a lot of this is physical. I know that I can make people feel warm and 
at the same time give them a sense that I am strong. It is a lovely combination. 
“ An important component of this is that I have a disability that is hidden. 
It means that I understand that there is a lot more going on for people than 
what can be seen. I understand that we are all different physically. I think it is 
why my empathy comes across in the first instant. 
“I think that we need to vocalise our Essence when we lead. I try to tell 
my story. I start with, ‘I am different physically and that is what makes me who 
I am, ’ and by doing that I enable others to share their own Essence. Then you 
connect and you get the infinity symbol flowing, the Energy exchange.
“When I led my team to the Commonwealth Games, I made sure there 
was a moment for us to share our Essences. It is really curiosity; I try to lead 
with curiosity instead of seeking out difference. For me I look at people now 
and instead of looking at the deficit model and searching for the weakness and 
negatives, I have the curiosity to search out their strengths. Because we are all 
so different, I wonder what skills they have got because of their difference. It 
is hard to do this because our brain wants to do the opposite. Think about the 
medical models of disability. They focus on the medical deficits. The doctors 
ask, ‘what does not work?’ It implies that you have ‘less of ’ something. I think 
we should flip it and say, “what have I got more of, because of, rather than in 
spite of ?” (Podcast 52)
It is up to you to decide if ‘body’ is in your Essence, but I urge you to con -
sider it. Especially if you are like me: you have only really noticed your body 
Essence | 91
when it has got in your way, prevented you from doing something and not de -
livered in its scaffolding role.
 How can someone who has been healthy most of her life, had five children 
and made it to sixty-five be so very blind? Body is firmly in my Essence now. I 
want to be a conductor who invites people to follow her lead without saying a 
single word. And I want in my very physicality to convince people that I am that 
wonderful combination of empathetic and strong.
Aparna sets us a challenge: “If we can start with our body and the truths 
that our bodies hold, I think there is a different source of Energy that we begin 
to generate. My experience as a brown woman will not be the same as the experi-
ence of my sister as a Black woman and will be different from your experience as 
a white woman. But we are all connected to our womanly bodies.” (Podcast 11)
92 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
The Sacred
W e move now from the body to the sacred. 
W e spent a long time trying to find the right word for this piece of Essence. 
Just as with motherness, Aparna offered us a solution. But first we must allow 
Katya to express why this piece of Essence is so hard.
“W e are almost afraid to put the sacred into our Essence and leading. T o 
bring things that are not solid or that are perceived not to be solid, into some -
thing that many of us are told should be strong and fixed. And of course, we 
want to understand things and our assumption is that to understand something 
we have to be able to see it clearly, to feel it tangibly and define it in clear and 
fixed terms. And yet I think that spirituality prompts us to broaden our under -
standing of leading. T o think about why we do what we do, as we lead, what the 
path is that we are pursuing, and why we are pursuing it. How we best use the 
Energy, power and privilege of leading.”
Katya spoke to me about how, in her eyes, spirituality makes us more 
empathetic, more aware of the bigger picture and more willing to share for a 
greater good. At the heart of spirituality for Katya “is the belief in something 
much bigger than us.”
When Katya uses the word ‘spirituality’ rather than words like ‘religion’ or 
‘faith.’ it is to respect and recognise that everyone has a different understanding 
of spirituality. But it was then that Aparna proposed not using the word ‘spiri-
tuality’ but rather ‘the sacred.’  
“I think we have conflated faith, religion, belief, divinity and the sacred in 
a very secularised way into ‘spirituality’ . Maybe we do this as a conscious choice 
because it avoids the more problematic things that are associated with faith tra -
ditions and religions which undeniably have had deeply misogynist histories. 
But I think the important thing to recognise is that all these things have always 
been a deeply powerful resource for women. I think for us to centre sacredness 
would be a very beautiful thing to do.” 
This inspired us, so sacred is what this piece of Essence became.
Essence | 93
Greatest resource 
For Aparna, it is a central piece of Essence for women: “W omen have had to 
rely deeply on the sacred. There has been very little else for them to rely upon. 
It has always played an enormously powerful role and acted as a resource for all 
women and especially women at the bottom of the social, economic and family 
ladders. When you are the last person who gets to eat in a family, how do you 
cope? I do not mean to reduce the sacred to a coping mechanism, but I do want 
to lift it up as something that has been and is today an important resource, and 
should never be underestimated. 
“W omen have always had to fight to seek out and then hold power from 
the margins. So we have to draw strength from unknown sources, which are 
not always obvious to us. A lot of times those sources are from our innermost 
recesses, from our deep lived experiences, from our intergenerational memory. 
And from our own understanding of the miracles of nature that happen within 
our own bodies, whether it is the cycles of the Moon or experience of pregnancy 
or ability to bear pain or to offer care. Where does this all come from? W e really 
do not know. But it does.
“I believe that women all over the world and through time have been hold -
ers of the secrets of what is sacred. W e have an ability to reach deep down inside 
and access our inner resources of power. For many women the sacred is their 
central Essence, and not just a label that we give to the religious tradition that 
we might be born to or the faith we might choose to adopt. T o me it is the 
mechanism through which we all access our inner power.” 
Every day
Aparna says that as a leader she is constantly trying to reconnect with the sacred 
in life because it is her compass for being a good person. She takes the time each 
day or each night, no matter how tired she is, to sit with herself, to acknowledge 
the presence of the sacred in her life.
“I find that in times when I am rushed and do not do this, I am more flus-
tered, perhaps angrier. This happened to me between September and December 
of last year when I just did not make the time or the space to honour the sacred 
94 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
in my life. This period took its toll on me. I have a horrible habit of being angry 
with myself before I am angry with others, which really hurts my sacredness. I 
draw ethical power, my moral Energy and also my physical presence from being 
in a sacred place or state.” 
Many ways
W e were with Anna when Aparna and I spoke. Anna was visibly holding back, 
but then burst out, “but you are a scientist, Aparna. How do sacred and science 
work alongside each other?”
Aparna replied, “I believe that there are many things that science teaches 
us that are gifts in terms of how we see and navigate the world. Equally I believe 
that science is just one of the many ways through which one can understand the 
world; in fact, one of the dominant ways that has garnered enormous amounts 
of power. But you also see that there are many places where it has been ineffec-
tive, and where rationality has not always won. W e know, too, that rationality 
should not always win because it can lead to unethical actions.
“I think that the fundamental quest of science is to answer questions about 
the unknown. And I think that the sacred is about respecting and holding the 
unknown. So I see no conflict.” 
I must tell you about Aparna and Anna. One a foundation director, a scien -
tist – and also a dancer, though few of us knew this. The other a young violinist. 
One from India, the other from Poland. About twenty years apart in age. 
I walked into a room to collect something on the first day of our meeting 
at the end of the First Expedition. As soon as I opened the door, I knew I was 
an interloper. I could not see either Aparna or Anna, but I knew it. It was in 
the air; it was not that I heard anything. Then Aparna and Anna walked past 
me out of the room, Anna cradling her violin. Still nothing was said. That eve -
ning, Aparna danced and Anna accompanied her on the violin. W e all watched, 
transfixed. At the end I asked them what had happened in that room. Their 
connection must surely, I thought, have started in that room, and yet I knew 
they had not been in it for long. They did not really answer me that evening, but 
sitting there speaking about the sacred, they decided to tell me more: “W e can 
Essence | 95
give away the secret of what happened. W e tried to speak to each other without 
words. Anna through her music and me through my movement. W e were both a 
little bit nervous and uncertain because we came from very different places. W e 
did not share the same cultural idioms and we did not share the same structure 
when it came to our art form. But once we began being our best selves for each 
other – and I think that is the only way I can describe it – it was magical and 
profoundly sacred.”
With this I finally understood more about what I had interrupted. What I 
had blundered into and sensed but could not explain. 
Later I asked Aparna if she had always been so ready to talk about and 
reveal what was sacred to her: “I get more comfortable as I get older. I have had 
decades to figure it out. At twenty-eight I would have been very uncomfortable. 
It makes me think that this is something we should talk more about in inter -
generational spaces. W e do not normally have enough time and, even if we did, 
I suspect we would still not discuss it. And even less how it affects us when we 
lead.” (Podcast 51) 
I cannot add much to this other than perhaps to repeat that the sacred and 
connecting with the sacred is so very different for all of us. Uncoupling sacred 
and theology, as expressed by Aparna, had a lasting impact on me. The truth is 
that I have never known properly why I do what I do and have no confidence 
that I ever will. Katya tells me that she runs in the mountains: “For me it is a 
‘sacred’ experience. A way of doing inner work.”
Aparna’s voice has dominated this piece of Essence, maybe you now see 
why. T o her go the final words. 
First, to urge us to “come face to face with the rules of the theologies and 
to challenge them. Because theology and the way that theologies have been 
constructed and written have too often created power structures and gender 
binaries. It will be incredibly hard to do this, because it feels somehow heretical, 
but I do not see how else we will take a really deep next step, even if we only do 
this on behalf of the body. Sadly, religions have done a wonderful job of making 
us be ashamed of our bodies. I think that we must honour our body as a very 
sacred thing to do.” 
96 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
And second, to take the sacred into how we lead: “I think that to draw 
upon all this as we lead is what gives us powerful ways to be empathetic. T o see 
connections that others cannot see. T o be instinctive about making connections 
when connections are not obvious. There are things that happen beyond the in -
tellect or beneath the intellect. So for me, that is why the sacred becomes a very 
deep well that I draw upon. And a way for me to really connect with the larger 
universe. By ‘the universe, ’ I mean my fellow beings.” (Podcast 51)
Essence | 97
Ancestors
This must be the right moment to move on to Ancestors.
I want to start this with Chulu. Y ou will rapidly discover why. 
“My name is Chulu Lucy T endai Chansa. Chansa means ‘an ant hill’ . An 
ant hill in Zambia can be as high as seven meters. They are big and majestic and 
made by something as small as an ant. My name speaks to the limitless potential 
that we as a community can have when we come together. The names Chulu 
and Lucy were the names of my paternal grandmother and were gifted to me 
at birth. T endai means ‘give thanks to God.’ It was given to me by my maternal 
grandmother when she was a political refugee in Zimbabwe; it is Shona for ‘we 
are Zambians.’ Chansa is my family name’ it means ‘wealth and prosperity.’
“I hope you can see that my names are a symbol of my heritage. They are 
the legacy that I inherited, and they are a reminder of the history of my family’s 
struggles and triumphs. My names are the means by which I can trace my fam -
ily lineage, and they are a source of my pride and strength. My names are also 
a prophecy; their words call forth certain attributes to my life going forward. 
“I have been fortunate enough to have travelled to a number of countries 
and met all sorts of people. The repeated inability or unwillingness to learn my 
name the way it is supposed to be said and pronounced deeply saddens me. My 
name only has five letters and yet I have been called everything from ‘Chula, ’ 
‘Chuli, ’ ‘Chalu.’ I mean, the list goes on. Where I come from, ‘Chula’ means 
‘to suffer, ’ and that completely changes the destiny that was intended by my 
ancestors when they gave me the name Chulu. The names were given with in -
tention, they were given to be a blessing to me for the rest of my life. When 
you do not bother to learn my name, what does that mean? I know a lot of 
African women who accommodate the environments they are in and change 
their names to sound more English, but it is like rejecting yourself, your iden -
tity, part of yourself. 
“So please call me by my name. It is ant hill, a monumental feat that was 
driven by community. I am a living Expression of giving thanks to God, and I 
am the daughter of wealth and prosperity.” (Podcast 6)
98 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Recognising
For Chulu, ancestors are firmly in her name, her Essence and her leading. For 
many of us, recognising ancestors in Essence has been a journey. A journey 
Selvie is mid-way through:“Recognising, taking ownership and honouring my 
cultural roots has not been an easy task. It almost felt unnatural in moments. 
Looking back, I have not been courageous enough to own and be proud of my 
cultural identities. The English language may unite our multicultural society, 
but globalisation has made it difficult to define where I belong. 
“I ask myself who I am and what does it mean to be Chinese/Indonesian/
Singaporean? As much as I have tried to diminish my cultural identity, it has 
shaped my likes and dislikes from a very young age and influenced my perspec-
tives and my preference for a certain approach to leading. Now I want to in -
tegrate my culture into all my work, to create a safe space for other women to 
share how their cultural identity has shaped them and take on board that there 
are diverse and nuanced approaches to leading that I need to embrace.” 
It was Hinemoa who shifted Selvie’s thinking when they were together 
on the First Expedition. Hinemoa had spoken of the female leaders in her 
Māori culture and how they influenced her: “I look to our whakapapa, to our 
genealogy of women. Papatūānuku, our earth mother, is the ultimate female 
leader. Her ways of leading help us navigate; her fundamentals make sense for 
me. Strong, nurturing, predictable, integral, honest, fierce. She provides a safe 
collective space from which to stand and flourish. A place of life cycles and of 
growth. 
“The ocean we can see, Hinemoana, is one of Papatūānuku’s children and 
gives her own insights into female leadership: of tides, persistence, energy, drive, 
abundance, depth. Hina is our Māori moon. She has a different name for each 
face she shows us across the month. It is a female Energy that leads time. I have 
been exploring her influence over many years.
“I am descended from Muriwhenua, daughter of Pōhurihanga, navigator 
of the Kurahaupō waka. The land was named for her and she for the land. That 
is our ūkaipō, the land that nurtures like mother’s milk in the night. When 
females lead, they have this nourishing aspect. I wonder about key moments 
Essence | 99
where we have experienced a sense of mana wāhine, female strength, standing 
in our own Energy.” 
Long journey
Hinemoa has a very personalised cultural sense of leading. It gives her an envi-
able certainty. For Fatima Zibouh, it has been a long and difficult journey bal -
ancing the Moroccan part of her identity and the Belgian part, a journey finally 
reconciled: “I can eat a Belgian chocolate with a Moroccan tea, and it is very 
delicious. The principles of Islam, I can find in Buddhism, Catholicism, even in 
atheism, because it is all about serenity, peace, justice, solidarity and love. When 
I understood that it is possible to combine all of my identities, I felt a kind of 
peace in my heart. It is very hard, for sure. But when you do feel it, despite ev -
erything around you, you can be proud. It is happiness.
“I cannot pretend that it has been easy. I would love for someone to give 
me some keys to understand the contradictions and paradoxes. Eventually you 
get there and accept the contradictions of chocolate and tea and you say, ‘it is 
okay’ . For me, this has been letting go but not a passive letting go. It has been a 
choice of being who I am, with the priorities I have, and not being too worried 
about what other people think or about people who ask me to simplify my iden -
tity. I have, after all, multiple ancestors like everyone else.” (Podcast 9)
It has clearly been and continues to be a hard journey for Fatima: “When 
people want me to be just one identity, I say to myself, ‘I am who I am, and I am 
brilliant. I am beautiful. I am powerful.’ And I go ahead with people who want 
to go ahead with me and for me and I give priority to the many voices which 
are inside me, my many ancestors. Of course, I face the intense social pressure 
from the majority, but it also comes from my own community. I have just come 
to accept that I am different and multipolar. 
“For too many years I thought that the key to peace and stability would be 
found through study; with study I would gain legitimacy. I tried to always smile 
and to be perfect. T o be simple. But now I say no. I am forty years old now. I will 
stop. I am who I am.” (Podcast 9) 
100 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Ayesha in Pakistan also recognises a contrasting balancing act emanating 
from her ancestry: “I know I have an internalised colonialism and an internal -
ised patriarchy within myself. I grew up in a culture and household where pa -
triarchy was the norm. I could never have escaped it. I was raised by a mother 
for whom the world was created for men and women were there to serve men’s 
interests. And yet I was also raised by a father who continuously, without realis-
ing it, countered all this and gave me wings. I must own this tug, this push and 
pull, as part of my own journey.”
Connecting
Like Selvie, I know that Hinemoa has prompted me to think about my ancestry 
more and how it has influenced how I lead. Because ancestors have so funda -
mentally framed and defined how Hinemoa leads, they are ever present for her 
as she says, “they create a source, a wellspring, a puna, of female Energy that I 
can draw on at any time.
“My mother died a long time ago and I remember feeling and sensing so 
profoundly that I had to move up into another generation. I was pregnant with 
my son; it was all very intense, but I also felt welcomed. Soon after, as a medical 
student, I was on a field trip. I was asked to do the karanga, the traditional call 
of women. I remember vividly feeling my mother next to me. 
“I love bringing forward the story of my great-grandmother who passed 
away in the great flu of 1919. I grew up with her picture in our home and I never 
thought about her death in the same way until COVID happened. Then for me 
it was like she was reaching forward to share all the ramifications of that era. It 
helped me to navigate the complexities of COVID. 
“I feel this connectivity across generations. I want to connect with our 
young women and our girls and at the same time I do not want to leave our 
older women behind. A lot of them have come through different kinds of colo -
nisation, and they carry their own pain. I have a sense of this role, of the cultural 
baton being carried forward and passed on. It gives me Energy. W e talked about 
leading as a source of Energy. I think about this Energy coming from our female 
ancestors.” (Podcast 55) 
Essence | 101
Hinemoa told me about the role that music and language play in this: “I 
uphold our tradition of opening discussion with waiata (song). Introduction is 
with pepeha, which is our time-honoured tradition of how we introduce our -
selves, how we respect those around us and how we locate ourselves in space and 
time. Singing is so important for us as leaders. It releases different energies. It is 
honouring a different experience of being human. And it is simply joyful, even 
if the waiata is sad. I have not learned a new song for a while, but I know that 
I want to and there are new songs and parts of songs that I will become more 
confident with. There is a unique Energy singing together.
“I seek out experiences of using our Māori language. I think when you have 
had to learn your own language, because it has been suppressed for so long, then 
that is very emotional. Because your language has become a separate and crucial 
part of your Essence. It does not matter if you cannot understand the words, 
you sense the vibration, and the vibration is healing. Using our language is a 
transformative aspect and it connects us back to our old people.” (Podcast 55)
T ebogo Matenge, a businesswoman in Botswana, told me how determined 
she is to do the same, however old fashioned it may sound: “The danger is that 
because everybody is doing it the W estern way, we feel that we should fall into 
line and do it the ‘sophisticated’ way. But if we do, we risk forgetting our own 
ancestors. In Africa I think we are increasingly realising that we must not. As we 
see other cultures, it sometimes makes us see our own more clearly. For example, 
if you look at our history, we have always shared, we simply do not want to have 
a full belly when our neighbours are feeling hungry. So people who do not have 
this instinct to share do not achieve much when they lead in Botswana. For a 
while when we were colonised, we sort of lost all this a bit, but I think we are 
slowly coming back to being who we were. 
“I also see in some societies women think that in order to lead they need to 
be more like men. More outspoken, harsher. In Africa there is a growing trend 
of women realising we can take our caregiving status and nurturing nature into 
our leading. W esterners seem to be going on courses to do this; on this side of 
the world it is natural.” (Podcast 24). 
102 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Pragmatic
Rouba is pragmatic after years of leading in the Arab world. She agrees, but also 
says that sometimes you have to step back, too: “I identify myself as a progres-
sive, liberal, modern woman. But at the same time, I identify myself as a woman 
with deep indigenous roots in my culture. I draw on them – not just for my 
Essence; they are also a source of my power. 
“I think you have to be able to make the link with your ancestors, but at 
the same time I think you must be able to uncouple from it too at times. The 
link is deep, and it empowers you. But sometimes a break from your ancestors 
empowers you too.
“I was invited to the UK parliament to speak about Syria. I had never done 
public speaking before. I had never done anything at all like that before. I was 
so scared as a twenty-two-year-old to talk about politics and human rights and 
refugees. It was a leap of faith that I had to make because I thought of the men 
and women in my Syria who were dying. The least I could do was to step up 
and talk about what they were facing. It was not even a choice; it was a respon -
sibility that I had to take on, because so many people were making far bigger 
sacrifices than I. 
“What helped me was being outside my context. I was disconnected from 
my place, my ancestors, my mothers and grandmothers, nowhere near the place 
or culture that I grew up in. A place where women are expected to act and be 
a certain way. Because I was outside of that context, I was operating outside of 
the norms, the paradigms, the structures that were designed for a woman in 
my home context. I could be whoever I wanted to be. I could reinvent myself 
and think about my identity differently. I could reinvent who Rouba was as a 
person, as a human, as a leader, as a speaker, as someone who is trying to do 
something bigger than herself.” (Podcast 10).
Essence | 103
The Seeds
Uma thinks about her ancestors in a way that is helpful. She names three kinds 
of seeds: the dream seeds, gift seeds and incomplete seeds.
“Dream seeds are the seeds we were born with and have somehow forgotten 
as we grow up. Gift seeds are the seeds full of promise and potential bestowed 
by our ancestors. And incomplete seeds are the seeds that our ancestors felt that 
they could not use to complete their dreams, so they pass them on to us.
“ Ask yourself, what are the dream and gift seeds that you carry from your 
ancestors? How will you pass them on? What are seeds that you need to let go 
of or even destroy? And which seeds must you cherish and hand on?”
Uma is focused on the incomplete seeds. She is determined “to name the 
incomplete seeds I carry and, in so doing, recognise the hurt and pain they have 
caused and still cause. And, with this, recognise the power that I now have to 
transform the incompleteness to wholeness. I also want to recognise that if I 
don’t, the angst, the negative Energy and the pain will pass on. I might do it 
unintentionally, but it would be forceful if I did.
“This is why I have worked hard on myself to heal and transform that in -
complete seed and hand it on as a gift seed. I know the incredible Energy of 
the gift seed. It radiates through us. W e absolutely must pass on wisdom so 
that those who come after us can remember their dream seeds, access their gift  
seeds and heal their incomplete seeds. Only then will we generate the Energy 
of leadership.” 
Looking backwards and forwards is fascinating. Ancestors matter, and so 
do the ancestors we will be for future generations. It makes me think of driving 
a car; you need a windscreen to look forwards and a mirror to look backwards. 
There are drivers whose eyes are constantly peering into their rear-view mirrors, 
and there are also drivers whose eyes are fixed on the windscreen. It requires a 
balance of both, otherwise you will cause terrible accidents. 
Uma’s idea of seeds makes sense to me. It has made me think of my mother 
and grandmothers in different ways. And certainly now, also, my daughters and 
granddaughters, and which seeds they will inherit from me. 
104 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Trauma
How we lead must be influenced by the trauma we have experienced and inher -
ited. This feels self-evident, but as with some other pieces of our Essence, maybe 
we put the trauma piece aside in the eagerness to fit in with status quo leading.
Experience 
It feels right to start thinking about trauma with words from two women 
who have faced it head on: Harriet Adong, who experienced war in Northern 
Uganda and its aftermath, and Asifa Hassan, a young Y azidi refugee from Syria 
now in Germany. They share their thinking on how their leading has been and 
will always be shaped by trauma.
First, Harriet: “Nobody understands the depth of what it means to be a 
survivor of war. Y ou do not even understand yourself how it takes your mind, 
your body, your spirit from you. Now they call us the builders of community, 
but to do that you need somebody who is whole, who can recollect herself. It is 
because of this that rape is used as a weapon of war. It puts us in a space where 
we cannot recollect ourselves.
“When the guns are silent, the only thing everyone wants to rebuild is in -
frastructure. They forget about helping women to pick up the pieces of what 
happened to them. And yet women will not rebuild a place that is not safe for 
them. They revert to the only place where they feel comfortable, and that is a 
closed space that nobody understands. People expect you to come out of this 
closed space in a snap. They say to you, ‘now it is time to get into the develop -
ment processes, ’ as if you should or could just close that door.
“I am very passionate about helping the girls and women rebuild them -
selves and our community. Because nobody is going to help us, we have to do 
it ourselves. W e have to find what we felt was lost and tell our stories like we 
used to when we sat under the tree. It is our role to share the story of peace and 
change the negative stories that are being told. 
“ And yet violence continues to happen. W e have men who were abused, 
abducted, returned home with anger, who have now become violent again. W e 
Essence | 105
have parents who have forgotten their role and do not even know how to handle 
their children born of war. This violence is like a time bomb; we do not know 
what will happen to this generation if we do not bring it back to life.
“So as we lead, we have to tell stories and make them about peace. Y es, we 
went through dark times, when children were separated, where a parent was 
forced to kill their own child, when Northern Uganda was covered with the 
darkness of rape, of killings, of slaughter. But that is the narrative that my com -
munity and I can change, to ensure that we know ourselves as people of peace. 
W ar should not determine who we are.” 
Asifa Hassan is part of the generation Harriet Adong fears for, born in 
another part of the world, in another part of the broken world.
“When I was in Iraq, the Y azidi genocide happened and I luckily survived 
it with my family. Many of my friends and two of my cousins were kidnapped 
by ISIS. They were in captivity for five years. 
“I have seen so many things. I try to always claim to myself that I am exag -
gerating them. That compared to the others, I have seen nothing. I tell myself 
that I am so lucky that I did not lose my father, my two sisters, my brothers. I 
tell myself that I am the luckiest person on Earth. I have been holding myself 
together by comparing myself to others and always thinking that when I get to 
Germany, I will be free. I will be so mentally and physically free and happy and 
safe. But it is not like that. At this point, I realise that I also have been through 
so many things. I have never been a child.” (Podcast 16).
Speaking to Harriet and Asifa, and to many women like them, I am re -
minded of what Jude said to me: “W omen have something in common, which 
is an acknowledgement of pain. They have been through obstacles, vicious 
knocks, difficulties and self-searching. And they make that available. They have 
compassion, the ability to self-reflect on the scars – the scar tissues. It is an em -
pathy without sentimentality.” (Podcast 12)
Impact
Ayesha sees such trauma daily in her work as a psychiatrist. She spoke to me 
about its impact on how we lead and on how she herself leads because, along 
with inherited and experienced trauma, there is secondary trauma.
106 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
“T rauma generally affects your emotional regulation, your cognition, your 
processes, your behaviours and your body. All of these are crucial to leading and 
show up in many ways. For example, trauma affects your decision making. So 
you are not able to make sharp, timely and confident decisions. 
“It affects your relationships. And given that leading is all about relation -
ships, this will have a huge impact. It affects your self-belief. It is not easy to 
illicit confidence in your team if you are not confident yourself. It affects your 
body. Katrina used that expression, ‘the body keeps a score, ’ and she is right. 
The score being things like irritable bowel syndrome, eczema, chronic fatigue, 
depression, anxiety, stress; they all show up in all sorts of different ways in your 
body as a result of trauma. This automatically affects your leading. 
 “When we think about trauma, we often think of war and displacement. 
But trauma comes in many shapes and forms. The most common kind of abuse 
in children and adolescents is not sexual or physical abuse, it is neglect. Neglect 
produces avoidance attachment problems that continue down the generations. 
And this inevitably shows up in leading too. Another example is that if you 
are a minority and you live in a space of fear, it might mean that you live with 
caution. Y ou are often unable to say that you belong, and do not want to attract 
attention to yourself. Again, this will play out in your leading.
“Then there is secondary trauma, where somebody living in, say, Pakistan 
may not actually see first-hand the trauma of race that resulted in the Black Lives 
Matter movement. But if you read, watch the news, watch movies, have exposure 
to social media and the rest of the world, then you are actually imbibing trauma 
from your surroundings. Because if you are remotely empathic to what is hap -
pening around you, which most humans are, you will feel the pain of others. 
“This secondary trauma can be intergenerational. It is passed on by narra -
tives in the family, by stories that are told from one generation to another. So 
you are able to feel the pain of others, just as if you are there and actually feeling 
it first-hand.”
Essence | 107
Personal
I asked Ayesha about her own experience. W e started to talk about Islamophobia.
“I saw it on the rise around me as I was moving up in the space of leading. 
I saw it mostly second-hand, sometimes first-hand, but mostly through hearing 
stories. Y ou hear of the trauma that people have suffered who look like you, have 
been raised like you and share the same faith as you. Y ou start thinking, ‘if it 
can happen to them or their children or their spouses or their families, then it 
could happen to me.’ So it shifts automatically. Little things make you question 
where you would not have questioned before. Y ou have an oversensitive smoke 
alarm inside you. Even a tiny statement or reference somewhere automatically 
ignites something in your brain. Y ou stiffen up and you start thinking, ‘is this 
happening because I am a Muslim?’ 
“What this does to me, as for most of us when dealing with trauma or the 
presence of trauma, I go to denial or minimisation. I have tried both of these. I 
have tried to keep ‘Muslimness’ in the back corner, not to talk about it because 
it feels unsafe. 
“I will give you a very concrete example. A colleague and I have started 
talking about the idea of incorporating cognitive behaviour therapy and re -
ligion into our work, looking at how growing up in a specific religion might 
manifest itself when doing cognitive behaviour therapy and how the ideas of re -
ligion affect people’s thought processes. Then we would look at how a therapist 
would bring them to light and try to work with them. W e have still not gone 
ahead with making this happen because it feels vulnerable to me. Even though 
in any other space, I would have jumped at a new idea right away.” (Podcast 56)
Global 
This conversation made me think about trauma at a global level and about co -
lonialism. It was an issue that came up regularly amongst the First Expedition 
group. I asked Ayesha if she thought colonialism had and continues to induce 
trauma for a large part of the world.
“Y es, it is an interesting trauma. Because colonialism is all about a ‘greater’ 
power coming in and proclaiming, ‘you’re not good enough, we need to come in 
108 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
and shape you and your society.’ Slowly, the colonisers’ views become part and 
parcel of how your systems function. It puts you in the back corner. Eventually 
you start to believe that you are not good enough and that whatever is coming 
out from the ‘greater’ civilisation is better. Y our sense of self becomes affected, 
your cognition becomes affected. Y ou are unlikely to take decisions the way you 
would otherwise. Y ou are unlikely to adapt to different environments. Y ou do 
not trust your own instincts or your own sense of self. 
“This one is intergenerational. Even today, in Pakistan, that gained physical 
independence over eighty years ago, there still exists the idea that anything that 
comes from the W est will be superior to whatever we are building indigenously. 
Even in the simplest of things. When I was growing up, I would go shopping 
with my mother and aunts in the cities of Quetta and Peshawer. The Baara, or 
markets, where you got imported material, especially cloth, like silk, chiffon or 
georgette, etc, were exciting for my aunts because these were not indigenous 
goods, they were ‘imported’ and therefore considered to be superior. 
“Even in our attitudes to women leaders, we think it is best to think like 
W estern women. And yet, the whole South Asian region has a long history of 
matriarchy and of very strong and well-respected female leaders. And mother -
hood used to be considered such a noble thing. W e talk of pregnant women 
needing to be safe, healthy, happy and content as ‘bearers of the future gener -
ations.’ But the W estern influence has shifted things. Our women leaders got 
written out of our history and the idea of motherhood is more of a burden, or 
an obstruction to a career pathway, like the W est.” (Podcast 56)
Healing
Ayesha: “I think when we lead, we have to make the idea of healing trauma 
possible and safe, and we can only do that by modelling it ourselves. The dis-
cussion around trauma scares people away. W e need open conversations around 
it. I don’t mean just going to the therapist; healing trauma comes from music, 
cycling, being close to nature. It comes from narrating our own story or from 
using humour.
Essence | 109
“I am not saying this is easy. Where I am, making yourself so vulnerable 
can have challenging repercussions. But we must listen to ourselves when we 
feel burnt out, want a pause or need silence. Because once we have stopped for 
a moment, then we might be ready to go again. If we go at full throttle all the 
time it will be hard to muster the Energy that leading requires.” (Podcast 56) 
As I listened to Ayesha, I was thinking about myself. I wanted to add to her 
list of what helps to heal trauma: the word ‘friendships.’ I will tell you why. My 
childhood had too much experience of women who drank too much. Now, fifty 
years on, if I go to an event and there is a very drunk woman there, my children 
circle around me, watching me carefully. Because they know that ‘Mum’s judge -
ment will go all askew, ’ not necessarily because the woman is behaving badly 
but because the presence of drunk women triggers something in me. For sure 
we need to spot the trauma in ourselves, but it helps if we have friends to circle 
around us, who spot when our trauma is going to manifest itself.
I think Stellah Bosire, a woman born in the streets of Nairobi who is now 
one of the most powerful voices in health in Kenya should end this section on 
trauma. She declares, “I have been a patient of severe depression despite many 
of my colleagues saying, ‘how can you be depressed when you are one of the 
overachievers?’ I tell them, yes, but it doesn’t mean that I can’t get depression. 
I am human, I have pain, I love and I cry. And that doesn’t take anything away 
from my leading. 
“I refuse to be branded ‘a strong black woman’ . I am a ‘vulnerable black 
woman’ . I am a girl who loves soft life, I am a pearl and I love soft feathery 
pillows. I don’t live to other people’s scripts; I write my own script and it has 
trauma in it.” (Podcast 66)
W e all hold trauma. It is real for all of us, and it plays out in how we lead, 
for all of us, but I am still in awe of Harriet Adong and Asifa’s determination to 
name and deal with their trauma. Thank you.

Education
On to education, the final piece of Essence that we uncovered on the First Ex -
pedition.
Education must have a huge impact on how we lead, especially if we take 
the word in its broadest sense – informal and formal, early years to lifelong, the 
education your family and community give you and the education that formal 
institutions provide. The biases our education instils, the instincts it nourishes, 
the confidence it bakes in, the opportunities it opens up – this is a big one.
Informal education
Saba gives us an illustration from the Arab world of the education that family or 
community gives us. It has parallels the world over. She captures the sayings that 
she grew up listening to and reflects on their impact on how she leads. 
“‘Ham elbanat lal mamat.’ This is said to you on the day you are born. 
T ranslated, it is ‘Y ou are a burden from birth to death.’ Why would a new life of 
a beautiful, innocent girl be a burden? Because everything about you is heavy, 
starting with your body. If it is beautiful, men will pursue you. If it is not beau -
tiful, no one will fancy you enough to want to marry you. As you grow up, 
anything that goes wrong is your fault. If you are harassed, it must be about 
what you were wearing, how you walk, whether you smile. Y ou force men to 
misbehave.
“‘Kol e’lak wa e’lbes lel nas.’ Basically, ‘you do not have a say in how to 
live.’ Y our opinions and decisions will be your father’s until you are handed over 
to another man. Y our secrets should never be shared, even if they burn from 
within you. Keep quiet, stay silent, it matters that your light shines on the out -
side, make it look as if you are living a perfect life. If you work, that is a plus 
because you generate income, but it does not necessarily mean that you have a 
say in using the income. 
“‘Shouroohum wa khalfoohum.’ Men are taught from a very early age to 
consult with their women and then do exactly the opposite. So with time, you 
will learn to give the opposite opinion so that men do exactly what you want. 
Essence | 111
And so, the dance starts, you learn how to live around men. But you never get 
the full life because as an individual, you do not exist. Y ou are someone’s daugh -
ter, wife, mother. 
“‘Haki tentain bekhreb betain, ’ or, ‘if two women get together and start 
talking, the result will be two ruined houses.’ Y ou are told never to trust women. 
Y ou just do not talk to them.” (Podcast 6)
Sayings such as these exist in most languages, accompanied by words like 
‘Huss.’ Saba utters it with her finger across her mouth. It says ‘keep quiet’ in 
Arabic. In Nigeria, Folawe tells us that the equivalent word is ‘farabale, ’ pro -
nounced with flair. She almost sings it as if it were the first word of a song. In 
Hindi, it’s ‘chup’ said crisply. The ‘p’ has finality in it, clearly pronounced with 
the intention of shutting down. There seems to be an equivalent word in most 
languages used to pin girls’ lips closed.
No one bothered to say it to Katja W eisheit, though, as she grew up in 
Germany. They didn’t need to, instead they had programmed her to ‘act the 
boy.’ She showed me a picture to prove it. 
“What you can see are two children dressed in sportswear, at a sports event, 
having a short break before their next big challenge. At first sight they might be 
two boys. Elbows on knees, sitting forward, cropped hair. But I can give you sec-
ond sight. One of them is a girl and this girl is me. She is acting like a boy. She 
knows that the camera is pointing at her, and this is why she tries even harder to 
look and act like a boy. She wants to present herself as a strong and tough boy. She 
wants the people to think, ‘wow, what a tough boy he is. I think he is the winner.’ 
In the following years, this girl will do everything to hide that she is a girl.”
Katja was heavily pregnant when we spoke, awaiting the birth of her son. 
“My mindset for the last twenty-nine years has been that if you want to reach 
something in your life, you need to be strong, fast, calculating, competitive, ra -
tional, analytical and bold. Y ou must not think or talk too much, and you must 
never let emotions get in your way. ‘Stop whining, do not feel pain.’ Up to now, 
all these successful behaviours have been connected in my mind with boys, so 
my logical conclusion as a girl was that I need to act like a boy. Do not wear too 
112 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
much makeup, do not talk with a high voice, do not talk with a baby voice and, 
in general, do not be interested in girl stuff.
“Feminism always gave me a distant feeling that I never felt connected to 
women. I never asked myself why I had no vision of success via a female ap -
proach. But then suddenly I gained access to the world of women and since 
then I cannot not stop uncovering myself as a woman. Now I am thinking about 
my future son, imagining him being the one in the photo, not me. I do not want 
him to act like a strong superhero. I want him to feel absolutely fine with just 
being himself.” (Podcast 6)
Impact
I sat with Andini and told her about Saba and Katja. She smiled. As an inventor 
she has often seen the consequences of this.
“I see a lot of inventors who sign contracts with the people that they sell 
their rights to without reading the contracts because they think ‘all the legalese’ 
will be beyond their understanding. I say to them, ‘these are your rights, the 
rights to what you have created. They are a portion of your soul. How can you 
assign them without reading the contract?’ I made this mistake in the past, and 
I learned the hard way. The real question is: how do people manage to convince 
us that, as women, we are not capable of understanding certain things?” 
The answer is probably education. I do not think I have to make the case for 
the impact of it on how we lead. It feels self-evident. But just before we move on 
to formal education, it is worth taking a step back and speaking to women who 
moved countries or cultures and assumed that it would mostly be the same for 
women wherever they went. Though Huss, farabale and chup equivalents are ev -
erywhere, there are unexpected differences too, and sometimes there are surprises.
Surprises
T ebogo talked to me about Botswana: “W e are a very small country, where the 
men went off to a different country to work in the mines. So a lot of women were 
left at home, running the household, making sure kids were fed, making sure jobs 
were done. It is in our DNA; we have always led because our men went away.” 
Essence | 113
She laughs about how confused W esterners are when they land in Botswana. 
“They ask questions like, ‘can I speak to the owner of the business?’ and I say, ‘it 
is me.’” (Podcast 24)
Sometimes it takes moving away to look back and see home in a new light. 
I talked to Anila Dehart, a successful woman in financial services who grew up 
in Albania and then moved to the US. “One of my surprises relates to educated 
women putting their career on hold, in some cases indefinitely, when they be -
come mothers. I’m not referring to women who prefer a different lifestyle or 
can’t afford childcare, I’m referring to women who feel they have no choice 
due to societal norms and expectations, particularly in cases where their male 
partners are high earners. I had assumed the opposite would be true in societies 
which are further ahead on the journey for women’s equality and equity. In con -
trast, my experience in my home country, Albania, is that while there is still a lot 
of change needed to elevate women’s place in society, education and careers are 
seen as non-negotiable.” (Podcast 35) 
Anna Afeyan Gunnarson, a scientist and philanthropist, had a comparable 
experience. When she moved from Sweden to the US, Anna did not think that 
she was going to a more developed country but rather an equally developed one, 
and yet, “In the US, the men I worked with wanted to take care of me. Now, in 
the beginning it can be nice that people want to take care of you when you are 
new in a country. On the other hand, it also implies that you cannot take care 
of yourself. I knew who I was, and I knew I could take care of myself and make 
choices for myself. I did not need to ask any of my male co-workers or friends 
how to do things. I had never sensed this in Sweden.” (Podcast 35) 
I suppose we all see things through our own eyes, sometimes thinking that 
our experience is the experience of all, and we make assumptions about others’ 
worlds, assumptions that seldom survive travel, and the surprises come both ways.
114 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Formal Education
Let this start with just how crucial formal education is and how deeply it frames 
how we lead. Isata sees this every single day: “ I work with mostly women in a 
rural area of Sierra Leone who are lowly educated or sometimes not at all. Never 
underestimate the limits this puts on somebody’s life. 
“When I moved back to my community as an adult, I ran for elected office. 
If I had never been to school, I would never have dared do that. I would not 
have seen myself as worthy to represent people because I would know that I did 
not know everything that I should know.  
“Only once you have been in a classroom and learned something do you 
realise there is always more to learn. Only then do you realise that you do 
not know everything, and that you don’t need to know everything. Education 
opens up your world so that you are able to seek new knowledge and find out 
about things. Y ou can learn things on your own afterwards once you have al -
ready got that basic foundation. But if you have never been able to be in a class-
room, you place limits on your life because you realise that you do not know 
as much as other people. And for women in particular in these rural settings, 
it does not just limit their economic activity. It limits their mothering, their 
revenue and what they measure within themselves. It is education that makes 
you able to question your current situation and to change it.” (Podcast 57)
Breadth
It is not just knowledge you gain. When I first met Folawe Omikunle, who runs 
T each for Nigeria, we talked about the school she went to as a refugee when 
she left Nigeria because of the military regime and how it formed a piece of her 
Essence as a leader. She talked of the headmistress:
“Part of my primary education took place in Benin, where Mrs Edna 
T ounou was the owner of the school and, at the time, it attracted students from 
across the African continent. I have vivid memories of the songs Mrs Edna had 
us sing together every morning. One particular song that has stayed with me be -
gins with the words, ‘No man is an island.’ When I reflect on who I have become 
today and some of the values that shape my life, I can trace them back to that 
Essence | 115
school. Mrs Edna recognised potential in every child, even the most disruptive 
ones, and she saw some form of talent in each of us. Every teacher, parent and 
individual played a role in uplifting one another. Looking back, our lives were 
uprooted, and we entered a community that was overflowing with love and sup -
port. I can still recall every word of the song she taught us: ‘No man is an island. 
No man stands alone. Each man’s joy is joy to me. Each man’s grief is my own. 
W e need one another. So I must defend each man as my brother, each man as 
my friend.’” (Podcast 10) 
Folawe had formed a fist as she sang and thumped the air with it, though I 
don’t think she realised it herself. W atching Mrs Edna T ounou lead must have 
had a profound effect on Folawe and instilled in her that women could be fab -
ulous at leading. 
This dawning awareness of women leading must be so important: seeing 
them lead and also making sure that girls get an experience of leading when 
they are at school. Lulu Raghavan is one of the foremost leaders in advertising 
in India. Looking back, she tells me that it was school that instilled leading into 
her DNA. 
“I was appointed School Prefect when I was in grade twelve. W e had a beau -
tiful uniform and I had all of these badges to say I was School Prefect, House 
Vice-Captain, Badminton Captain and Basketball Captain. And we had this 
sash with the colours of all the houses. It was a visible signal of leadership. That 
was the first time I realised that I was a role model that my juniors were looking 
up to. I had to be conscious of how I spoke and how I behaved. When I think 
back, it made me feel I was a leader, it instilled in me the desire to lead and to 
inspire others, it sowed the seeds of my ambition and what I wanted to be.” 
(Podcast 67)
For Katya, education instilled knowledge and leading – and also something 
more, as she found herself surrounded in her school by people from everywhere. 
“I studied in a school where the premise was to have young people together 
from different countries and socio-economic backgrounds; countries that had 
historically been in conflict with each other. The hope was that by living, eating 
and studying together, we would build friendships that were beyond the typical 
116 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
interactions between people of different countries. The experience shaped ev -
erything in my life since then. 
“Every time I hear about something that is happening in the world, I asso -
ciate it with a person that I know from that country. It humanises things. It is 
why I am very careful now about seeing things in a binary sense. I understand 
that there are so many truths behind every conflict and version of history. And 
I think that this acknowledgement of nuance is something that I continue to 
carry with me as I lead.” (Podcast 5)
The power of education to open things up is clear. Opportunities, possi-
bilities, ambitions, self-confidence, insight. But of course, as with all pieces of 
Essence, there are shadowy sides too.
Baked in
Ayesha is determined to bake out the competitiveness that was baked into her 
by her education: “It is sometimes a monster that keeps growing. This idea that 
somehow you will be left behind. I have to push it back and say to myself, ‘the 
world is about coming together.’ I grew up in a very competitive school, college 
and higher education system. But it doesn’t sit well. I want to be different. Am -
bition is fine. It is great to want to have a dream and work hard towards it. But 
competitiveness, I think, works against achievement. 
“People talk about ‘leaning in.’ I just do not want to do that constantly. It is 
just not right for me, and my sense is also that you really can only lean in when 
you have a certain privilege. I am not white; I am a woman. I have not grown 
up with privilege. I do not come from a very high socio-economic status. It is 
okay to lean in and people will allow you to lean in if you have privilege, a cer -
tain accent, certain skin colour or certain degrees all stacked up, then it works 
fine. But if someone like me leans in, it is not taken well at all. Y ou are told that 
you are too pushy, you’re making people angry, or frankly upsetting people.” 
(Podcast 4)
For Jude, it has taken a conscious effort to make sure her education does 
not frame how she leads. She sees things that were baked into her that she has 
since consciously strived to remove.
Essence | 117
“I think we were given terribly damaging ideas of superiority. W e were told 
that we were better. It had a hugely damaging effect. W e go into dialogue with a 
sense that we need to just persuade somebody else and that eventually they will 
come around to what we think. Because we’re right. T o counter this, we have to 
start again, with humility. And it is not easy.” (Podcast 12)
Isata reflects: “I often see such a sense of superiority play out with leaders 
who confuse intelligence and education, and yet they are not the same thing. 
Somebody may not have a formal education, but they have something to offer 
in terms of solutions regardless of how long they have been in the classroom. W e 
must recognise the impact of learning even outside of the classroom. This sense 
of superiority is often then compounded when they measure somebody’s educa -
tion or intelligence based on how well people speak English. Speaking English 
is absolutely not a benchmark for intelligence.” (Podcast 57)
Permission
Isata also talked about how some leaders don’t recognise that education is de -
livered differently in different places: “In Sierra Leone we have a more instruc-
tive way of learning where you repeat everything you have been told, first by 
your mother, then your teacher and eventually your boss. Y ou do not disagree 
with adults. In the UK, you are encouraged to challenge what you’ve been told 
and find solutions for yourself. If you have been educated in the UK and find 
yourself leading in Sierra Leone, you need to take the difference into account. 
Understanding it takes a while because initially you assume everybody is edu -
cated in the same way. Y ou have to know that there are differences and make 
allowances for them.” 
I asked Isata how she had seen this play out as people lead. “It  takes  a 
while for people who have not been in an environment where the permission 
to push back has been granted to do so. I think they are suspicious. I remember 
when I was Minister of Social W elfare; in the first couple of meetings, the civil 
servants at the ministry thought, ‘who is she and which sky did she fall out of ?’ 
Ministers are supposed to be in charge and tell people what to do. And my take 
was, I am here, I am new. The civil servants have been here for years; they know 
118 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
better than me, even if it is just institutional memory. So if I do not seek their 
advice, I am not going to learn anything. But they were suspicious. Only after 
a while did they realise that I was genuine. Then they started to bloom. Y ou 
have to really listen and keep on listening, because education does not prepare 
everyone for this. Y ou have to create the space for people to have their voices 
heard, feel safe enough to make mistakes and suggest solutions, contribute ideas 
and overall feel valued. Y ou have to listen with your heart. Only then will they 
give you theirs.”
But there is a caveat here, says Isata: “It goes both ways. Once questioning 
is allowed, then you have to accept that somebody is going to question you. 
Many leaders do not like this. I do.”
Then Isata sees another angle: “Sometimes I can question others too 
aggressively. Some people may not be ready to have the – as they perceive it 
– rug pulled out from under them. So I have to go more gently and find ways of 
moving together until we hit common ground.
“Basically, you have to evolve as a person who knows that there is always 
more to learn.” 
W e return full circle to Isata’s first thoughts: “Y ou have to be sure enough 
about the learning that you have already received to do this. Only once you have 
learned to do so will you become teachable.” (Podcast 57)
Rebels
As Isata and I talked about education, we realised that there was another as-
pect of our schooling that we had in common. It had instilled in both of us a 
rebelliousness – or at least it had failed to erase it from us, because I suspect the 
rebelliousness was a dream seed handed on by our ancestors for both of us. I 
told Isata about how, aged twelve, I took my class out on strike because our head 
teacher had said that we could only have a Christmas tree in the main entrance 
of the school and not in every classroom. Oh, what privilege I have had that this 
was all we had to strike about. Anyway, we all went on strike and refused to be 
educated.  
Essence | 119
Isata started giggling at this point. “I want to go back to a twelve-year-old 
me as well. I was the class rep in a campaign to change the school uniform. W e 
were able to change what we wore every day to school. After that, nothing is 
impossible. Will I ever wield that kind of power again? It is really hard not to 
believe that anything is possible after that.” 
It has been a few years since either of us were twelve. W e have both worked 
with many ‘highly educated’ leaders since then. I asked Isata what she finds 
the most irritating when she does. “It is arrogance that you know everything. 
The idea that one person can know everything. The very idea shows a lack of 
education, and it makes for bad leading because everybody who has been in a 
classroom knows that there is always more to learn and that you can learn from 
people that you are intending to teach. If you are sitting on a high horse from a 
position of ‘I know more than you, ’ it will limit you.” (Podcast 57)
So education is well established in our Essence. Informal education which, 
with good fortune, instils deep confidence, and formal education, the gift never 
to be undervalued or understated, especially at its best. Both have a huge impact 
on how we lead. But not quickly, says Ayesha:
“My mother’s voice keeps resonating in my head, that ‘nothing is going to 
come out of it, this struggle toward gender parity. This is just a completely lost 
cause. And I do not know why you keep fighting it and losing so much sleep 
over this.’ Being a realist, I don’t think it is going to change in my lifetime. My 
hope is that it will change for the generations to come. T o me, that is enough of 
a reason to work on change right now.” (Podcast 4)

Your Essence
These have been seven possible pieces of Essence: motherness, nature, ancestors, 
the body, the sacred, trauma and education. Y ours will differ from mine, but 
they will all, to a greater or lesser extent, deeply influence how you lead. 
I make no attempt at a summary. Leading is personal and messy; I leave the 
summarising to you. T ake the pieces of Essence that make sense to you, add the 
ones that need adding for you, put aside the ones that do not resonate. I say put 
aside rather than discard because you may want to reconsider them some time 
in the future, just in case you change your mind. Indeed, I hope that you do 
change it and evolve– that is a crucial part of leading and of the infinity symbol.
So before we move on from Essence, please don’t forget to add your own 
pieces of Essence. There will be eighth and ninth pieces that are right for you. 
Anna will have added ‘music, ’ I am sure. I would add ‘outsider’ into mine. Why? 
Because I have always felt like an outsider from the age of three when my par -
ents delivered me to a playground where everyone spoke French and nothing 
but French. I spoke nothing but English. I stood at the back of the line to which 
I was allocated with hand gestures. I stood there wondering how I was going to 
talk to anyone. I have never experienced huge bias as so many have, I have not 
survived war or been a refugee, but I have always felt like an outsider. I suppose 
that I have become one as a result. I know that I feel very uncomfortable if I 
am ever invited to go ‘inside’ . No, I must be honest, I behave badly if ever I go 
inside. I love the outside; I am privileged enough to be able to choose to remain 
on the outside. I know this has affected how I lead. For a long time, I thought 
behaving as an outsider was one of my weaknesses, now finally I recognise it as 
a strength. But when I offered up ‘outsider’ to the Expedition members, it did 
not resonate with anyone. So, like many, I will be adding a personal piece to my 
Essence, quietly.

Journal
Solo
Do any of the pieces of Essence described by the members of the First Expedition 
resonate with you? Which do? Which don’t? What might you add? Once you have 
named the pieces of your Essence, write a paragraph on each one. Why is it in your 
Essence? Has it always been? Describe it a little to yourself. How has it affected how 
you lead? Now put the pieces into the central Essence circle in your map. Make the 
size of each one reflect its relative importance to you in how you lead. Remember 
this is not about how important each piece of Essence is to who you are, but rather 
to how you lead.
Figure 6: My Essence 
Maybe, quietly, go for a walk and think of the dream, gift and incomplete 
seeds you have inherited and intend to hand on.
Capture everything in your journal. Some will be points that you may not 
fully understand at this stage. Just put them in as questions to come back to.

As a group
Share your maps as they evolve. If you have a sufficiently diverse group and you 
have invested in enjoying each other, you will start to discover very different think-
ing as you discuss them. And this might trigger changes in how you lead people who 
are very different from you.
| 123Elements
With Essence pinned down, we look at how it shows up as Elements in how we 
lead. As these Elements become clear, some will definitely need to be jettisoned, 
some reframed and one very clearly identified. Then many others will need ele -
gant combining even though they may appear to be on opposite ends of a spec-
trum; even in conflict, they are best combined. Because leading requires us to 
operate along a continuum between them, constantly reassessing and reposi-
tioning what becomes a sliding scale between two Elements. Combined, they 
make the whole greater than the sum of the two Elements. This is something 
that women are very adept at doing. Indeed, it is often the tension and creativity 
sparked when they combine that generates the Energy of leading. 
But more on this later. For now, what do we consciously and deliberately 
jettison, abandon and dump?
124 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Jettison
I am going to leave it to some great women to list them. Let’s not spend too 
much time on them, they don’t deserve it – just dump them.
Good girl
Mai Chen, a famous lawyer in New Zealand, says, “I was brought up in the Chi-
nese and Kiwi cultures. I was told to keep my head down, swallow my views and 
opinions, never complain, do not fight, do not be angry, walk away, please peo -
ple, be agreeable, be silent, never aggressive, toe the line, be a good girl. And this 
was from the people who loved me. They did not want to see me hurt. Confucius 
had good advice for tall trees in strong winds; he said that if you wanted to avoid 
them, be a stump.” Mai does not hold back: “T o change the world you need just 
sometimes to be disagreeable when there is a good reason for being so.” 
Camilla Sievers, who has survived the endless ups and downs of successful 
entrepreneurialism, adds, “Why in my professional life have I always needed 
approval from older, mostly white, more experienced and more ‘superior’ men? 
I never really feel that I have done a good job until they tell me that I have.” 
Camilla promises me, “this stops now.”
Room at the T able
Sarah: “I have decided that there is plenty of room at the table for us all. And 
that there is sure to be even more room if enough of us get to the table and put 
down the ladder for others to climb up. And that if there is not room at that 
table, there are plenty more tables.” (Podcast 49)
The ladders need putting down – and more. When someone climbs one, 
they must then turn around when they get to the top and look back down it to 
then stretch out their hand and help others as they climb. The look in their eyes 
as they stretch out their hand must be beautiful to see. It has been done for me 
a few times over the years, and I will never forget the sight of the outstretched 
hand and the belief in the eyes. W e must jettison the ‘not enough room at the 
table’ attitude. 
Elements | 125
Mona believes this passionately and adds, “Don’t forget the option of cre -
ating your own table, a table that you love being at, with the people you choose 
around it” . Then no ladders are needed.
Dividing by Age
The diversity in ages was one of the most important features of the First Ex -
pedition. Aparna and then Anna described its impact on them: “The positive 
restlessness amongst the younger women on our Expedition was something I 
was grateful to witness, ” says Aparna. “ As they tiptoed around their sense of 
power and established their own space in the room, in them I saw a mirror 
that reflected my own transformation. A transformation that has been brewing 
within me for years, but I only discovered it as I looked deep into the eyes of 
these young women. I realised just how much I needed them to know myself.” 
And Anna: “There is a moment in life when you want to be a sister, not a 
daughter. I’m thirty-one. I was craving for women’s wisdom. I was trying as a 
child to feel accepted by the women in my life. But this unique group of power -
ful women on the Expedition made me feel my own power. I no longer feel like 
a child. Being seen as a woman by a man is ordinary. But being seen as a woman 
by a woman is another thing.” 
Divya Kapoor interviewed both Aparna and Anna when she joined the 
W omen Emerging team. “Y ou got the impression that on the First Expedition 
everyone had left their hierarchies – especially the hierarchies of age – out of 
the room like you would leave your shoes out of the temple.” 
I balk every time I hear the expression ‘harness the talents of young people.’ 
Just think about what a harness is. A large, thick piece of leather that we strap 
around an animal’s neck to force it to do something it doesn’t want to do or to 
prevent it from doing something it does want to do. The last thing we must do 
is harness people, and most especially young people.
Ignoring Self
Leila: “I learned this the hard way. There were times when I saw taking care of 
myself as optional, as secondary to other priorities. It did not end well. Caring 
126 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
for yourself has to be prioritised intentionally, not seasonally or occasionally, 
not on my birthday but every day. 
“T welve months or three hundred and sixty-five days is a long time, so we 
cannot be at the same level every minute. Nowadays I think of the seasons, ex -
panding and contracting Energy to nurture myself so that I can give what I want 
to give to the fights I’m fighting. If I don’t, I am not useful to the people I lead.” 
(Podcast 36)
Latanya Mapp Frett, who runs the Global Fund for W omen, has seen this 
too many times: “The biggest mistake is to just keep going. Thinking you are 
not doing it for yourself but for other people. That you will keep going until 
you cannot function anymore. Y ou think it is just you doing the sacrificing, but 
in truth everybody around you has to sacrifice themselves in order to get things 
done. Y ou feel it is all on your shoulders. Y ou know that success means you have 
to work like a dog, be everywhere at once. This is when decline starts, not just 
for you but for the work.” (Podcast 29)
Minimising Me
Antonia Belcher is always looking for talent to work in the businesses she runs: 
“If I look at a male CV and a female CV for a job, I will find the guys have upped 
the ante on all their things that are marginal, and the girls have taken them 
down. And when I interview the girls, I ask, ‘Y ou put here that you have done a 
bit of this; how much have you done?’ I then rapidly realise just how much they 
had ‘done.’ Whereas if I challenge the boys, I might illicit one small example 
which is made to sound like it was a full-time sprint for six months. W e have to 
get the balance right, to stop minimising while resisting the pressure to swing to 
the other extreme.” (Podcast 27)
Alex Moore, now so successful in the med tech field, looks back at oppor -
tunities she almost missed: “I minimised myself. I was doing quite well; I had 
two children and a husband with a busy job, and I was really enjoying my job. 
But I had this self-imposed limiting view that I could not go any further because 
of my children and the industry that I was in. Without speaking to anybody. I 
resigned myself to it. I was dissatisfied but just getting on with my lot. I con -
Elements | 127
vinced myself that this was as far as I could go. That other women might choose 
to work long hours and be in the office every day, but that I couldn’t. 
“Then a promotion offer came up. I politely refused it. This lit a light bulb 
for my boss. She said, ‘you do not have to do it my way. I work the way that suits 
me. I am interested in what you can bring to the business, not in making you a 
carbon copy of me, ’ and that lit a light bulb this time for me. I applied, got it, 
found my way that works for me, my family and for the business.
“When I look back, I am embarrassed by what I imposed on myself.”
Falling for Flattery
Erica Su looks back at her successful career in financial services in China, at the 
moments when she has said ‘no’: “Flattery can get you into a mess. Into accept -
ing roles that you are not right for or not right for now. All the time you should 
say to yourself, ‘it is my story, not yours.’ Y ou should ignore the flattery and ask 
basic questions of yourself: 
“Can I do it? Y ou should not be tempted by the tendency to overstate com -
petence. Y ou have to have your own realistic assessment about your capability 
and also the job requirements. Y ou will not be a 100% match, but it should be 
reasonably reconciled.
“Do I want the responsibility? Sometimes you feel you are better off to 
step back a little bit. Do something more comfortable or not stretch so much. 
Y ou must have the courage to step out of your comfort zone, but how much you 
want to stretch yourself is a personal judgement not only for yourself but also 
your family, as they are going through the journey with you. 
“ Am I OK with the sacrifices? Y ou analyse them and do not pretend that 
there are not sacrifices. Ask yourself: if it is something of a sacrifice now, will 
you get it back later or will you never get it back?
“What will I miss? If you are really excited about the new things in a job, 
even if there is a lot of uncertainty, then go for it. But if you feel passionately 
about the things that you are doing right now, then think carefully. 
“Is it really worth it? There are sure to be politics and lots of managing peo -
ple and conflict and also you will be scrutinised more as a woman. W ould you 
128 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
feel more comfortable and happier with more sense of achievement by staying 
where you are?
“Do I have the power base to support me in this new role? Y ou will need 
a power base to carry out a new initiative or to show a result. This one is very 
critical.
“Will I accept the trade-offs on my health? Health-wise, if you get to your 
limit and have to stretch too much, then you will have mental stress, and your 
physical body will react to that pressure. 
“These questions are not self-limiting, they are self-defining. I suppose the 
outside world may see them as self-limiting and people around you will almost 
goad you into doing what you should not do. Of course you do not want to ap -
pear to be self-limiting, but don’t let this lead you to say yes if you really know 
it should be no. It takes more courage to do self-defining and to say no when ev -
eryone around is flattering you because they want you to say yes.” (Podcast 10) 
Enough
Katrina: “ Am I smart enough? Am I attractive enough? Am I kind enough? Am 
I thoughtful enough? Am I helping enough? Am I grateful enough? Am I pro -
fessional enough? Am I fit enough? Am I relevant, positive, slim, loving, good, 
old, wealthy, valuable, quiet, important, objective, loyal, sexy, clear, authentic, 
flexible, confident, spiritual enough? Am I interesting, ambitious, honest, caring, 
passionate, happy, successful, healthy enough? Am I calm, mindful and funny 
enough? Am I strong enough? And humble enough? Am I gentle enough? Am I 
open enough? Am I curious enough? There are so many enoughs for all of us as 
women, and then it goes one step further for me. Am I disabled enough? 
“It was that last one that was enough for me. Enough is enough. I am abso -
lutely tired of seeking that sweet spot of trying to find just the right amount. It 
takes an incredible amount of Energy, time, attention, and it’s simply exhaust -
ing. I decided to take the risk of abandoning the enoughs and to believe deep 
down that I am enough.”
I just could not resist the temptation to tease Katrina with a memory, so I 
asked, “do you remember you once wore a W onder W oman outfit?”
Elements | 129
 “Y es, I did. A friend was putting together a series around gender issues. She 
asked if I could be her subject. Erica is right about flattery. I was flattered into 
wearing a W onder W oman outfit. W e took photos of me at work, shopping in 
the supermarket, holding my baby, hanging out the washing and then coming 
home and being that sexual goddess to my husband. I talked about doing ev -
erything, with a beautiful smile on my face. Isn’t that interesting? Some twenty 
years ago, I did that. I am a different woman now, though I am not so sure that 
the world is all that different.” (Podcast 11)
So seven things to jettison. Some you won’t need to jettison because you 
have never suffered from them. I have never felt the pressure to be a ‘good girl, ’ 
though I have seen the effect it has on others. And you will no doubt add some 
that are specific to you, strange things that emerge from your Essence which you 
may not see at first but definitely need to be dumped.
130 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Reframe
This might take a bit longer. For whatever reason, some of our greatest strengths 
as women have become framed as weaknesses. W e will be reframing and regain -
ing them here. 
When people ask me about whether I ‘suffer’ from imposter syndrome, my 
answer is “yes, thankfully.” I add ‘thankfully’ because the syndrome keeps me 
humble. Think for a moment: what would it be like if the alternative to having 
imposter syndrome was to think that you know everything or that you have 
a right to be where you are? I prefer imposter syndrome any day, even if it is 
sometimes a struggle.
When people push back on my passion or anger with the words, “let’s not 
get too emotional, shall we?” my answer is, “I am so sorry, can’t you do emotion? 
Is there some way I can help?”
When people, steeped in analytics and data, dismiss my instinct as ‘irratio -
nal, ’ my answer is, “let us combine forces. W e need both.”
When I struggle with privilege, now I frame it as responsibility. When 
noisy people tell me to speak up, now I ignore them. When everyone on the 
First Expedition decided to dump the words ‘leader’ and ‘leadership, ’ now I sim -
ply reset to the verb ‘leading.’
There is a lot of reframing to do. I will leave it to more beautiful voices than 
mine to elaborate. 
Imposter Syndrome
Jude: “Most of us have a version of imposter syndrome. Or most of us have a 
level of appropriate humility where we would not claim to be leading. I am told 
that I am leading by others. If this is the impact I have, then I am grateful and 
will carry on working towards being better at it. 
“I think it is a good thing that you never fully own a sense of being a leader, 
even if other people urge you to believe that you are one, because the essential 
quality of self-reflection and self-doubt balanced with confidence is a good thing. 
Elements | 131
“W e must own the imposter syndrome as an asset and not let it shy us away 
from leading, because we need each other to lead.” (Podcast 12)
Rouba: “I did not know I was leading until quite late on when people 
started telling me that I was. People were coming to me for advice, and I was 
always thinking, ‘who am I to give them this advice?’ I remember one of the big 
moments during my journey to leading was when one of the first people in my 
team left. W e had an open-hearted chat and she said, ‘Rouba, I expected much 
more guidance and mentorship from you.’ I had only ever thought of her as a 
very strong woman to whom I had nothing to teach. At that point I realised that 
the way I look at myself is not the same as how other people look at me. Maybe 
we are scared to recognise ourselves and hold ourselves to our true value. Maybe 
it is a form of the imposter syndrome. Maybe it is about time that I step up into 
the shoes of how people see me.” (Podcast 10)
Zenna Hopson Atkins has just said yes to joining the advisory board of the 
Shetland Space Centre, which will launch the first vertical rocket in the UK: “I 
said yes because who would not? It’s space. It’s rockets. It’s vertical launches. It’s 
really exciting.
“W e need to just say yes to doing things that we do not normally do. W e get 
put in boxes, we slide into our swim lanes and then we want to stay there. It is 
vital just to get out there and say yes to stuff that we at first think we cannot do.
“I said yes years ago to chairing OFSTED, which is the organisation that 
inspects and regulates everything to do with education and children services 
in the UK. I said yes because I got expelled from school. I did not pass my ex -
ams. I had to start from scratch, get a career and work my way up the ladder. I 
remember when the OFSTED board were talking about ‘those parents’ whose 
kids were currently getting into trouble at school. I had just received a call to say 
that my son had been given a fixed term exclusion because he had been naughty.
“I said yes to being on the board of the Royal Navy because I could see 
that I could get some real change in thinking and attitudes towards the climate 
through. I turned out to be the longest serving non-executive in the Royal Navy.
132 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
“I have learnt that all-male teams don’t do themselves any favours; they get 
stuck in group think. So we have to overcome a sense of being an imposter and 
say yes. Get in there and challenge the group think.” 
Catherine, who has heard the expression ‘imposter syndrome’ right 
through her career in STEM, says, “I don’t think women actually have imposter 
syndrome any more than men do. I think the difference is that women are self-
aware enough to know they have imposter syndrome. I think that men tend 
to feel like that is not an OK thing, so they cover it up even to themselves.” 
(Podcast 33)
Emotional
Hinemoa: “I have had covert and overt messages to not be so emotional. They 
say, ‘if you are going to lead, to be out front and in a position of responsibility, 
you need to stop showing emotion.’ I think that is absolutely wrong. One of the 
things that we need to do more of as women leaders is to show feelings, both the 
vulnerability and the anger.” (Podcast 1) 
Jacqui Gavin has worked in government and the corporate world in the 
UK. “I am proud to be able to cry. Now that I have transitioned from being a 
man to being a woman, I am not ashamed of crying any more. I never cried as 
a man. I had to show strength. I don’t think I could have cried, but if I had it 
would have been behind a closed door. Now I see crying as a wonderful strength. 
I don’t mean uncontrollably; I don’t sob uncontrollably. I cry simply because it 
is a good thing to do.” (Podcast 27)
Ani is all over this one, looking at it from her monastic community in 
Nepal: “I find men suffer more than women because they need to control their 
emotions. If you cry as a man in front of the society, they will say, ‘Oh, such a 
weak man.’ How men are brought up in our society is very unfortunate. In the 
name of being brave and tough, men can become unkind and inflexible. In the 
name of strength, they become very weak and fragile.
“W omen are comfortable to shed tears. It helps us to release our stress and 
our suffocating emotions. I cry very frequently. At times, I feel bad about it. 
I ask myself why I so easily have tears in my eyes. I think maybe I am going 
Elements | 133
through pre-menopausal symptoms. But then on the other hand, I feel like it is 
good, it is healthy.
“I see the great monks gradually becoming more and more soft and sensitive. 
The tone of the voice starts to change, it becomes more motherly.” (Podcast 23)
Catherine wishes that, as with the imposter syndrome, men would catch 
up: “I think they are just as emotional as women; they just cannot show it. 
W omen are used to showing their emotions and it makes them lead better. Men 
do not have that awareness. They only really allow themselves to show one emo -
tion and it is a negative one: anger, because it is the only acceptable one for 
them. They don’t allow themselves to feel hurt or sad, and certainly not in the 
workplace. They must exhibit the stereotype, that very confident and lack of 
emotion kind of thing. 
“The problem is that emotional men who are hiding it do often raise the 
emotions in meetings by displaying the only emotion they allow themselves: 
anger. Then meetings become too full of anger too quickly.” (Podcast 33)
Ayesha is sick of the remarks about emotions. These are the ones she dis-
likes the most: ‘Why are you so angry?’ ‘Why are you so angry all the time?’ and 
‘Why do you take it so personally?’ She suggests banishing them: “There are 
things that happen that make me angry, and I am right to express them as such, 
even if it is not what people are used to. And if it is personal, then I am going to 
take it personally and respond in whatever way I should. T oo often the question 
is followed by ‘let it go’ even when it’s something that is overtly unfair, wrong, 
unethical or unprofessional. I am really clear. If it feels right to express emotion 
and anger, don’t let people stop you.” (Podcast 4)
Instincts
Mona: “Somehow, we must reframe instincts as something that we ourselves 
trust. Only then can we persuade others to trust our instincts. 
“ A hunch, an intuition or instinct is a powerful tool for leading and often 
overlooked because it is not a quantifiable hard skill, yet that is exactly why it is 
so powerful. Intuition is the ability of our brain and sensory nodes to store the 
information that feels right and warn us about situations that are potentially 
134 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
dangerous. These highly developed nodes are pathways in our brains forged 
from our unique life journeys. They allow us to sift through the myriad of our 
lived experiences without too much conscious effort.”
Liz illustrated this with a story: “I was with my family in France. I was 
about ten years old. I was a confident swimmer and I wanted to cross a river 
to buy an ice cream. I started off swimming towards the ice cream shop. Then 
I got caught in a current and I started to panic. It was pulling me in a different 
direction. There were people on the bank yelling where I should go to on the 
bank. I panicked a bit more and I decided to swim harder. My body tensed up. 
It was truly exhausting.
“When I got to the other side of the river, I sat on the bank. I realised that, 
actually, if I had trusted my own instincts and just relaxed into the current, 
I would have landed on the bank a little further down than I had intended. 
Fighting against the current had not been necessary. I should have had confi-
dence in my ability as a swimmer and trusted myself and my instincts.”
Listening
Not long ago, I was sitting with a group of professors at a college in the US. 
Good people, they had been trying to sort out a problem: that male students 
dominated their classes with questions, and women were often silent. Silent, 
I thought, or listening? Anyway, the professors told me that they had set up 
workshops for women to help them ‘speak up.’ The trouble was that the work -
shops were having no effect. I suggested that they might run workshops for men 
on coping with silence, listening and resisting the need to jump in. I had very 
little impact; I don’t think they were listening. Somehow, we have to reframe 
listening as active, engaged and committed, and stick to it when it feels right.
Liz explains: “It seems obvious, but it is surprising how often listening does 
not happen, quite often because ego permeates the situation. The best people 
who lead make the space to listen, not just to hear what they want to hear or 
to pick up on the bits that they were waiting for, eager to catch confirmation 
bias. They listen in a genuine way, with their ears and their eyes. They seek both 
the verbal and nonverbal cues and pick up how people are behaving with each 
Elements | 135
other. They sense the dynamic of the room, in the Zoom call, at the community 
meeting or within the team. And they reflect on it, ask questions, get people’s 
perspectives. Never in a tick-box way. I think such a degree of curiosity is only 
possible when ego is set aside by people who know they do not have all the 
answers. 
“ And when the listening is done, the final step is to say, ‘Okay, I have lis-
tened, I hear, I see. And now this is what we are going to do. Do you want to 
come with me?’ They create a space where people cannot do anything but say 
yes, because where they are going looks interesting, fun and exciting.” 
I asked Liz if this is always possible. Surely from her years in the army there 
had been times when there was no time for listening.
“I have seen this in so many contexts and in some really challenging situa -
tions. It may seem that this listening approach is best in a nice comfy conference 
room, but I would say it is even more crucial in a more hostile situation. It is 
then that you really need to double down on listening and pay attention, be -
cause that is when it really matters. People who lead well do that in abundance, 
and when they are under pressure, they do it even more. 
“I have a simple answer to people who say, ‘there was no time to listen.’ 
There is always time to listen. The false economy of not listening is what people 
often overlook in their urgency to act – to act or to be seen to be acting. It does 
not require bringing people together for a long discussion or retreat. Sometimes 
it is about listening for one minute. It is about pausing and saying, ‘can you give 
me your thoughts on the situation? What is your perspective?’ It can be trans-
formative even if it is a few minutes.
“T eams can really get themselves into an upward spiral when listening is 
done well. If as a leader you get into good habits with your team, they know 
they will have an opportunity to share and be listened to, then they get really 
good at expressing what they want to say – and quickly. It takes a while, and 
at the start it can be quite frustrating, and some may take quite a long time to 
say their piece, but as you get better as a team, it very quickly becomes a really 
effective and efficient process of sharing. Because you have built that trust. They 
136 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
know they will be heard so they are willing to step up and give their perspec-
tive.” (Podcast 59)
Melissa Berman, another huge investor in women, says that listening is not 
just extremely active, it’s also extremely exhausting “as you try to understand 
what both the text and the subtext are. T o sense the context, to spot what people 
want you to hear. It takes a lot of emotional labour, to the extent that it needs to 
be stepped back from at times so that you do not get burned out.” (Podcast 30)
So listening is a crucial part of leading. It needs reframing as an active and 
not a passive activity.
Privilege
Folawe put a great deal of thought into the issue of privilege during the First Ex -
pedition: “I have always acknowledged the privilege I had. My father, a success-
ful businessman with connections to government officials and elites, possessed 
native intelligence and strong business acumen. He made a lot of money early 
and that gave him access to some privileges. I was well aware of the privilege that 
came with it. 
“Over time, I have witnessed privilege from various perspectives. I have 
seen marginalised and discriminated people who are continuously blocked and 
unlikely to taste privilege. I have seen women who have been oppressed while 
pursuing power and are now using it to oppress others. I have seen some women 
who use their privilege as a weapon, others who exploit it for personal gain and 
women who trample on those with less power.
“On the other hand, I have also witnessed wonderful women with privilege 
who use their power to uplift others, to open doors and sponsor other women. 
They recognise that privilege comes with responsibility. So I have stopped view -
ing my privilege with embarrassment and discomfort. Now I see privilege as a 
responsibility. It is my duty to use my privilege in practical ways for the benefit 
of others.”

Leading Itself
Right from the start we decided to reframe to the verb. It is a verb because 
leading is adapting, evolving, reforming, caring, listening. It is not static, rigid, 
sculpted or established. Liz and Alia want to go further and reframe leading in 
our minds as water.
Liz: “Leading, like water, takes many different forms. W ater can be ice – 
strong, hard and resilient – and sometimes that is what it needs to be. W ater can 
be liquid – flexible, evolving and adaptable, moving into the spaces where it is 
called for. W ater is steam – reaching everywhere, almost invisible; it cannot be 
caught, and it must be about this sometimes. W ater can change shape to fill a 
tall bottle, a round vase, a long pipe or a deep tank, and that is what it is about 
in this ever-changing world.” 
Alia: “Seas hold things that are bigger than themselves, whether you look 
under the ocean surface or at what life is being birthed in marshes. When I 
think about my own journey of leading, it has been most powerful when it is 
bringing people together to build something that is greater than the sum of the 
parts. In the ocean, we find coral, fish, and all working together under the sur -
face. The water is holding it all. 
“ And water comes with Energy. It can be angry and destructive or calm and 
supportive. When we lead, we have to be aware of the Energy we’re creating and 
the spaces and ecosystems we are birthing. 
“I think there is something deeply powerful about seeing leading as provid -
ing a container for connecting things that are greater than ourselves.” 
Liz sees more parallels between water and leading: “I often think about 
what is happening above the surface and what is happening below it. About 
what am I projecting to the world above the surface, and about how much I 
want to share of myself below the surface. How much of my Essence should I 
carry and reveal in the rooms that I walk into? Because Essence is with us all 
the time, spoken or unspoken, useful or not useful. There is something really 
beautiful about this as a metaphor of the above and below, what we can see and 
what we cannot see. Both are important.
138 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
“Then there is the ripple effect of water. Sometimes the challenges that we 
face in the world can feel pretty overwhelming. Y ou think, ‘how I can possibly 
as one person address these enormous barriers?’ I think water offers the analogy 
that as one droplet or one pebble we can make our own ripple. And a multitude 
of us each making our own ripples make change feel more achievable.” 
So there is a lot to reframe as well as to jettison. Again, not all of these six 
reframes will resonate with you and you will undoubtedly add more that are 
specific to you. 
I admit, the reframing won’t happen just like that. But it might be faster 
than you think. Once you adopt the imposter syndrome; once you see emotions 
and instincts as the assets that they really are, as soon as you decide that what -
ever privilege you are fortunate enough to have is a responsibility; and once you 
have dived deep into the waters of leading, then you might surprise yourself 
how rapidly you reframe. 
The next question must then surely be: for what purpose?

Think through what you intend to jettison and reframe. Some of the things the 
members of the First Expedition chose to jettison and reframe might resonate with 
you, others won’t. Y ou may also have things to add. 
Figure 7: My Elements
The priority for me is to jettison IqSe (ignoring self ) and Mi (minimising) and I 
need to reframe Li (listening), ImSy (imposter syndrome), Em (emotional) and 
Pr (privilege).
Give yourself practical examples of what you need to stop thinking or doing for 
each one and write down in what circumstances you think this will be most difficult 
for you to do. Set yourself a few targets. Make them as specific as possible, like ‘at the 
next team meeting on …. I will …. ’ 
 Speak to some of the leaders on your list and ask them about reframing. How 
have they managed to do it? Ask them under what circumstances they forget to 
reframe and instead revert.
140 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Think of someone you trust with whom to share your thinking. Preferably 
someone who will be good at reminding you if you forget to jettison or reframe in 
the future.
Keep capturing the insights as you go in your journal. Y our map should now 
be getting more detailed.

T alk through what you all agree should be jettisoned and reframed. Figure out why 
so many of you have some in common. Push each other hard on practical ways to

Elements | 141
Find 
From our Essence we must draw a crucial element: purpose, an Element never 
to be jettisoned and only to be reframed with great care. Whether it is a clear 
choice or accidental or even reluctantly, why are we leading? Motherness, na -
ture, the body, the sacred, ancestors, trauma or education and all the pieces of 
Essence that you will have added; how do they frame your purpose?
I believe that leaders who are not clear on why they lead will struggle to 
lead people and they will struggle to lead themselves. T o build the resilience to 
keep going. My father said, ‘don’t lead if it is a round of applause you seek’ and 
he was right. They are rare; you need something else to sustain you.
It might be for Harriet Adong the vision to rebuild the war-torn commu -
nities of northern Uganda. Or for Erum, the determination to get water to vil -
lages in Pakistan. Or for Laura, the commitment to greener energy in Scotland. 
Or for Camila, the dream of a Brasil that protects the Amazon. Or it may be 
Fatima bringing the women of Bruxelles together. Or Erica building the econ -
omy of Shanghai. Or me trying to inspire women to lead. Or Paula Langton 
focused on climate change: 
“W e have been setting our science-based target as a firm. W e have decided 
to go for raising fifty billion dollars towards climate funds. W e started off with 
a thirty billion target. W e have raised eighteen billion so far and I have just 
convinced everyone to go for fifty. W e kept pushing it up bigger and bigger. 
Breaking the target down made it feel OK, and even I began to think, ‘I can 
actually do this, ’ and now everyone feels it and it has become everyone’s shared 
vision. It is what I can do from where I am, and it will have a huge impact.” 
Or for Leila, it’s about hope: “My first job was as a teacher in a refugee 
camp. It was during that time that I came to understand the significance of hope 
in the face of adversity. I realised that despair, which is the absence of hope, is 
a luxury that individuals grappling with displacement, loss, poverty or natural 
disasters cannot afford. And neither should we. I discovered that the starting 
point is to believe, even if the outcome is uncertain, in the potential for a pos-
itive result. Simply having faith that we will navigate the path as we go along.”
142 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Leila adds, “Purpose is the key to generating and sustaining the Energy 
required for effective leadership. It allows us to remain optimistic about the 
future and to choose which problems are truly worth fighting for. Once we have 
identified those issues, we can determine the specific Energy we need to bring 
to the fight. For me, that Energy is synonymous with hope. While it is natural 
to feel anger towards inequality and devastation, I believe in channelling those 
emotions into unwavering determination and optimism. Intentionally choos-
ing not to succumb to despair, and instead fostering hope and trusting in the 
possibility of change is to me synonymous with leading a fight worth fighting.” 
(Podcast 36) 
How do you find purpose? Go back to Essence; part of it has to be there. 
And go out into parts of the world you don’t know, maybe across your street, 
maybe further afield, part of it has to be there. Alison would then advise find -
ing a way to reflect: “One of the things I have learned most from yoga is that it 
gives you the space and time to really consider what is most important. Certain 
thoughts float to the surface, others float away. As women we often have many, 
many priorities. W e are wrestling with too many challenges and all at the same 
time. Having a way of reflecting and giving yourself the time to figure out what 
is really important and what is your most important goal is hugely valuable.” 
Y our purpose then becomes your compass. Y ou will need it to accompany 
your map as you explore. It will also make leading easier because the people you 
lead will sense it in you and choose to let you lead them.
Elements | 143

Go in a dark room or walk up a mountain and ask yourself what your purpose is in 
leading. Capture it however you want, but keep it. It won’t be perfect, it will evolve; 
that is the way of things. Remember, it’s not your purpose in life, it’s your purpose in 
leading. They may or may not be the same.
I was mystified when I was given this advice, but then a friend told me to 
quietly and privately write down the few things that I will be proud of as a leader 
when I am on my deathbed. It was a bit morbid, but I have them and they have 
provided me with a good compass over the years, especially when big decisions have 
had to be made.
Y ou don’t have to share your purpose, but people will sense that you know it. 
Now you have added your compass to your own map which is evolving fast.

Help each other to find the questions to ask themselves which will help them find 
purpose. Deathbeds don’t work for everyone. Then leave each other to find their 
own answers, with no requirement to share them or not to share them.

Combine
Before we go any further on Elements, Uma is going to insert a health warn -
ing: “Self-awareness and delving into our Essence and Elements is a  dou -
ble-edged sword. It brings a lot of pleasure and confidence, but it also brings its 
share of pain. The more self-aware you become, the more you need to co-hold 
the pleasure and the pain of things that are both within your control and those 
that are way beyond your control. This is one of the reasons why I think leading 
is so hard to do.” (Podcast 7)
I said earlier that one of the reasons to do an Expedition is that leading 
is wonderful, and I meant it. But it is also at times very tough, excruciatingly 
lonely and it makes you frighteningly vulnerable. They say you are there to 
make key decisions, but in my experience you are there to make fine calls often 
between two perfectly viable options. They say you have to forgive people easily 
for their mistakes, but in my experience it’s the forgiving of our own mistakes 
that is the hardest. They say that you should not seek praise or credit, but I must 
admit that if you never get any credit at all, you can feel that everything you do 
is pointless. This list could go on for pages and pages. But the hardest piece is 
the one Uma highlights: you get to know yourself far too well, the good and 
the bad. 
Like everything to do with leading, it’s undoubtedly both wonderful and 
tough. Keep your purpose firmly in mind and hold on to the reality that you are 
unlikely to achieve it alone. Remember that if you lead well, you will occasion -
ally make something good happen and you will get to watch the people around 
you achieve more than they ever thought they could. 
So with Uma’s health warning in mind, we proceed on from jettisoning, 
reframing and finding purpose to combining. Katrina was up for this from the 
start: “I love that opposing Elements combine. W e can be incredibly warm and 
loving and at the same time direct and strong. It is all about knowing when to 
step into one or the other and knowing that you can have a mix.” (Podcast 52)
The word is ‘combine, ’ not balance, because balance is too much about 
trade-offs. I am confused when people talk about ‘work-life balance’ as if one 
exists without the other. They are not parallel universes, never to be bridged or 
Elements | 145
revealed to one another. There is no balancing here, only combining: they are 
both me, each one enriching the other. And combining is something women do 
excel at, even those things that seem diametrically opposed. 
Here are some examples of Elements to combine. Y ou will have many more, 
but here are some by way of illustration. They are combinations of Elements 
emerging from your Essence which may appear to be almost diametrically op -
posed and even in conflict, but it’s in the combining of them that sparks fly and 
Energy is generated. 
I think of them as on a sliding scale along which you move to different po -
sitions at different times. Never get stuck at one end or the other, keep assessing, 
calibrating, adjusting all the time.
Humble and Visible
Visibility is a prerequisite for leading. Whether you are leading from the front, 
the middle, the side or the back, you are always visible and must always be visi-
ble. Not all the time and in every place, but overall visible. This is important for 
many reasons: to gain trust, inspire others, generate Energy, be accountable... 
the list is long.
This visibility does not indicate a lack of humility. The two combine un -
expectedly well. It was Mona who first linked the two words: “Visibility and 
humility are two sides of the same coin. They are not mutually exclusive. Y ou 
can be humble about the work you do but, to really amplify your impact, you 
must be visible. Visibility does not mean that you are bragging or that you’re 
showcasing yourself; you are highlighting an issue so people can identify the 
path to change. Many of us struggle with this, but it is a false narrative that if 
you are visible, you are not humble. As a child growing up in Calcutta, I worked 
with Mother T eresa. I remember someone observing that Mother T eresa was 
both humble and visible. And, of course, she was. I realised then that you can 
and must be both.” (Podcast 20) 
Anna thinks humility and visibility are often seen as irreconcilable in lead -
ing because ‘ego’ is such a misunderstood word: “Y ou can also have ego and 
humility. Ego is simply an awareness of yourself. Y ou cannot be a conductor of 
146 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
an orchestra – you cannot lead a group of musicians and stand in front of an 
audience – unless you have a certain level of ego. Quite a low level, but it has to 
be there. It is like chilli in a recipe that just boosts the taste. It is all balanced. W e 
need all the ingredients; they just have to be combined well.”
Humble
Liz reflects that sometimes we complicate leading too much, that it is a hum -
ble activity: “The women all around the world who get leading right are the 
ones who are simply paying attention. There is nothing magic, loud or theatrical 
about it, they just pay attention and do so with humility. They have the simplic-
ity in just looking at what is around them, observing, listening – really, actively 
listening – and then acting. When they come up against challenges, somehow 
they are able to set aside their egos, really focus on what they have been told 
and what they have observed. They reflect on this and then do something about 
it. I think that is great leading in its rawest sense. I have seen women do this in 
some of the most challenging of circumstances, be it war, natural disaster or in 
just day-to-day living. They bring a level of simplicity and clarity that inspires 
confidence and calmness in those around them. It is humble, and humbling to 
see.” (Podcast 7)
I asked Liz how she displays humility. “By uttering the words, ‘hey, I just do 
not know.’ They inspire confidence in others so that they share, bring their own 
answers to the table, know they will not be laughed at or ridiculed for coming 
up with unexpected suggestions.” (Podcast 7)
And I asked the same of T erri Hord Owens, who describes herself simply 
as a pastor (a successful pastor at that); her answer was by “not claiming the 
credit” . She added that her ultimate inspiration for this was Mary in the Bible: 
“Her story is painful and difficult. She became pregnant at what scholars think 
was probably about fourteen years of age. She lived through immense shame 
and then the angel came down. From then, she raised this amazing human. 
“W e can look at Jesus and say the success of that mission had a whole lot 
to do with who Mary was. But I do not imagine that she was the kind of person 
who was walking around saying ‘See what I did.’
Elements | 147
“I think real leading is not about credit. If you fight for it all the time, the 
chances are that it is not justifiably yours. If the credit belongs to you, you will 
get it. 
“I worked for someone who needed to have vocal credit for everything that 
happened. I said to her once, ‘do you not realise that the success of this place 
reflects well on you? People will ascribe it to you whether you claim it or not.’ If 
you are constantly looking for credit, then people begin to raise questions about 
what your real motives are.” (Podcast 22)
Latanya, who backs so many women leaders, says that one way to lose hu -
mility is to “surround yourself by a bunch of yes people who are just so enam -
oured with who you are that they never tell you the truth about where things 
are headed. Instead, you need to surround yourself with people who will tell you 
what is right and also wrong. People who will call you on your bullshit, because 
otherwise all of us get very big heads.” (Podcast 29) 
Alison believes that yoga provides a source of humility: “When you start 
out doing yoga, you think ‘I am going to be able to turn myself into human 
pretzel’ when you may not have the bodily aptitude to do it. Y ou must know 
what you are good at.
“Leading is just the same. It may turn out that you are not a financial ge -
nius, but you need to be financially literate, and you will have to push yourself 
to develop basic financial knowledge. But to do the finance really effectively, 
you are going to need to find an accountant to support you. 
“Of course, in leading as in yoga, if you do not challenge yourself, you will 
never know what you can do. But you do sometimes have to allow the other 
person to become the human pretzel.”
Julia Neuberger, too, describes herself simply as a rabbi (she is a very suc-
cessful rabbi). She believes the elegant combining of humility and visibility lies 
in “getting on with it.” Deborah from the holy texts is her inspiration in this: 
“She is a judge; she has been given this title and named a prophet. This is some -
thing that normally only a man would do. But Deborah just gets on with it. She 
judges without any complications or any excuses. The practice at the time was 
that judges sat where the people could find them. Deborah does this and she sits 
148 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
under her own tree. What I really love about Deborah’s story is that she makes 
no excuses for who she is. 
“I think one of the most important aspects of leading is to be comfortable 
in your own skin, not to be afraid of who you are, humble but not too humble, 
not making excuses for why you are there or for how you do what you do. I 
think a lot of times we feel that there’s some accommodation that we have to 
make about either our femininity or our approach. W e think we have to step 
into a system and assimilate into it, as opposed to bringing who we are and how 
we do things and sit there visible under a tree.” (Podcast 23)
Fiona Campbell is a partner at McKinsey who advises many leaders. She 
loves this, and adds that once you get this level of humility and ego right, “the 
same level of ego maturity translates to that of the organisation you lead in. And 
that if you don’t get it right, whatever purpose you may want to put in place for 
the organisation is going to be lost at the door.”
So we are after a level of humility that does not shy away from visibility, it 
just does not crave it.
Visible 
Why do we then shy away from visibility? I certainly did, for two reasons, both 
connected with my Essence. The motherness piece caused me to confuse visibil -
ity with lack of privacy: my kids were young, I was exhausted most of the time 
and also I didn’t want them to get dragged into my work. An ancestry piece in 
my Essence also played a part. My family came from the northwest of England, 
where ‘showing off ’ or ‘getting too big for your own boots’ was almost the great -
est sin. Visibility could never have combined with humility in their eyes.
So for years, as Common Purpose got bigger and bigger, my profile as the 
founder and CEO remained low, maybe even decreased. It stayed that way for 
a long time until I discovered that if you don’t talk about yourself then others 
will talk about you on your behalf – especially online. Some pretty unpleasant 
people locked onto me and talked about me obsessively, unpleasantly and com -
pletely inaccurately, and I spent years on the back foot. It passed but it was not 
Elements | 149
pleasant. I discovered that if you lead, you must be visible even if you don’t want 
to be – and it has nothing to do with a lack of humility.
It is not as if I didn’t know that already. I was very visible with my col -
leagues, customers and stakeholders. I knew from the very early years of lead -
ing – and I was lucky, I started young – that if you lead, you must explain who 
you are to the people you lead so that they understand where you are coming 
from. They don’t always have to agree with you, but they do need to know a bit 
about your Essence. With luck and consistency, they start to trust you, even 
sometimes feel affectionate enough about you to forgive you for your mistakes.
Y ou have to explain yourself, to reveal yourself and your thinking, and you 
also need to be physically seen. I recall years ago giving this advice to a fellow 
chief executive who was painfully shy. Her colleagues assumed that because she 
was invisible, she must not care. Far from it, shyness is very hard to deal with. 
I suggested to her that each day when she got to the office, she walked around 
the building to see and to be seen. A week later we met for lunch and as I went 
up the stairs to her office a young man stopped me to complain about the lack 
of electricity and lift. He asked if I knew how to contact the new electrician. 
“New electrician, ” I replied. “Is there a new electrician?” He said, “She started 
last week. She has been going through the office every morning looking at the 
overhead lights.” When my friend and I sat down to lunch, I suggested that 
she continue to walk around, but stopped looking up at the ceiling as she did. 
I promised her that if she prioritised being visible then people would start to 
talk to her.
My colleagues, customers and stakeholders were never the problem for me. 
It was the wider world – especially the online version of it – that was. I learnt 
to apply my commitment to visibility beyond my normal circle, however much 
I hated it.
One last thought on visibility: make sure you learn to make a speech. It is a 
crucial skill for leading and it is only acquired through endless, painful practice. 
It makes you deeply visible and it means you can share your dreams and ideas in 
a way that is humble and humbling and generates vast Energy.
150 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Empathy and Distance
Leading is about relationships. Building relationships requires empathy. Em -
pathy can get in the way of distance. Leading requires some distance. Empathy 
and distance form an elegant duo and combining is difficult: it requires regular 
attention, a sensitive radar and acute judgement.
Empathy
If for no other reason than that today’s world is full of trauma, primary and 
secondary, empathy feels ever more essential to leading. 
Both Claire, looking at global security, and T wila at global warming, echo 
this point. Claire: “Given the scale of conflict and uncertainty across the world, 
you’re going to have to deal with trauma. Y ou’re going to have to deal with the 
legacies for generations of people who do not have a place they can call home, 
where they can feel at ease and feel they can settle.” (Podcast 38) 
T wila: “I sometimes hear people talk about a new normal and that is sim -
ply not a concept. Change is now and accelerating. No one will know precisely 
what the full range of change is to come. But they will know that we have to 
work our darnedest right now to minimise the change. And for many, they will 
never see the upside of the actions they take now. This means that there are a 
wide range of emotions that leaders have to be aware of, because they will need 
to give space for negative, fearful, difficult, angry and sad emotions in many of 
the people they lead, as well as for the sense of loss of things that were familiar 
and memories of youth. 
“Leading will mean helping people to change those difficult emotions. T o 
inspire, bring people together and move forward.” (Podcast 38)
Bin, who, from her position at EY, has second to none access to data and 
research globally, agrees: “Empathy is a critical component of leading today. It’s 
now the level one stuff; having the self-awareness to relate to other people. In 
the end, leading is about inspiring, motivating and relating to your fellow team 
members, colleagues and to everyone.” (Podcast 14)
Folawe reflects on who she ‘caught’ empathy from and how much she cher -
ishes it. “When I speak of leading with love and empathy, I am reminded again 
Elements | 151
of my former headteacher, Mrs T ounou. She operated with love and empathy 
towards everyone, from the cleaners and security personnel to the teachers and 
students. If a child was disruptive, she would inquire, ‘Have you had breakfast?’ 
or ‘How did you wake up today?’ She always paid attention to what was hap -
pening around her and to whom. This approach has shaped the way I engage 
with people. Before passing judgment, it is important to understand why some -
one may be behaving in a certain way and to consider the deeper issues they may 
be dealing with, which we may be unaware of. It is simply about being kinder in 
our interactions and relationships with others. Everyone is facing their own bat -
tles, and everyone is striving to be better and to give their best. Engaging with 
people fully requires having that kindness within you.” (Podcast 10) 
For every woman involved in the First Expedition, empathy was a prior -
ity. Leading requires it, but it has to be real empathy, says Victoria Cordoba, a 
woman who has had a tough life made all the tougher by intolerance. She is sick 
of what she sees as the casual and vapid use of the word empathy. She has heard 
it used a lot, but not often been in the presence of the actual emotion.
“People today claim they are empathetic because it is a good word to call 
themselves. But in reality, they are not, because empathy is shown by actions, 
not by words. Being empathetic requires a great internal work, to take yourself 
out of your comfort zone and into the life of a completely different person. It 
is not easy. It is a very brave act to be empathetic to someone who is completely 
different from you. T o be curious about other people’s religion or lifestyle.
“I have grown up in Argentina. I felt feminine since I was four years old. I 
dressed up with my mother’s clothes. All my world was always feminine. People 
in school isolated me, and I isolated myself to protect myself. No one wanted 
to play with me, everyone was calling me names. When I started secondary 
school, for two years, I never went to the bathroom. I was petrified to go there 
and be harassed by the boys. I listened to music, watched films and read books 
to survive. At seventeen, I had my first boyfriend. Then I found out what night -
life was. It was heaven to me. I became a drag queen. I was so famous. It was my 
revenge for all of the years that people bullied me.
152 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
“I concentrated on being the best artist that I could be. It took me all over 
the world. It was a triumph to me. I was showing the world who I was without 
any mask. I was a drag queen for eighteen years, and then I decided to change 
my gender. Growing up in Argentina at the time, it was very difficult to become 
a trans person straight away, so when I reached forty it was the right time. 
“It has been hard. T o get through every closed door, you have to pay double 
the price. But you keep going, and going no matter what and when you fail, 
your sister will lift you up.
“I will tell my story to anyone just to see if I can plant that seed of empathy. 
Real empathy, not fake empathy.”
W e come back again and again to words and their ineffectiveness. Victoria 
says that the word ‘empathy’ is used carelessly, as a badge, with little depth.
Ayesha and Harriet Nayiga add that empathy is not even the right word. 
They distinguish it first with compassion and then with sympathy.
Ayesha: “Empathy is the quality of feeling the pain of another person. It is 
wonderful, important and rooted in kindness. But when empathy does not lead 
to an action, it can be an emotion that keeps you layering and adding on with -
out being able to do anything about it. This very quickly leads to frustration 
and empathy fatigue. It is too strong a word, but you feel useless: I am feeling 
the pain of the human existence around me, but I cannot do anything about 
it. Compassion may be a better ambition; it is when you shift the emotion of 
empathy to an actual act of kindness.” 
Harriet Nayiga is a midwife in Uganda. “Sometimes you see that a mother 
is in need. Sometimes it is urgent and sometimes she imagines that it is urgent, 
but she definitely thinks she needs something. And sometimes, according to 
you as a midwife, it is not what she needs at that moment. 
“Then you have to boldly tell her that this is not right. She may be going 
through a painful experience and your heart and mind may be taken up so that 
you want to cry with her. But if you do, you will fail to provide the necessary 
care. So during her painful experience, you stand with her to show her love and 
care, but you remain strong and standing on the truth as you see it. That is being 
empathetic, not sympathetic. If you are sympathetic, you may become so weak 
that you cannot help this mother appropriately.” 
Elements | 153
So we proceed to distance, as Harriet Nayiga says, “because empathy slides 
to sympathy too easily if there is not enough distance.” (Podcast 28)
Distance
Back to Folawe: “I found myself in a position of leading almost unintentionally. 
It was something I stumbled into and had to navigate. I was an introvert who 
preferred solitude. Overcoming my introversion was the first challenge I had 
to face. The second challenge was that my intention was always to ensure that 
everyone was fine and happy. But at the same time, I am results-driven, and I 
struggled when people did not meet expectations. I distinctly remember some -
one telling me, ‘If you want to be liked, you can sell ice creams, but do not lead.’ 
In that moment, I realised that leading does not guarantee universal approval 
or happiness with your decisions. I learned that I needed some distance to make 
sound decisions and to cope with a certain level of unpopularity. Sometimes 
you have to make decisions based on what is best for the cause you’re fighting 
for, rather than seeking approval or empathising solely with people’s problems. 
Y ou must be prepared for others to become angry or upset with you. This reali -
sation was one of the most game-changing discoveries of my life.” (Podcast 10) 
Vidya expresses the combining of empathy and distance beautifully: 
“Sometimes what I see in myself is too much empathy. As a leader, there is a 
danger that you put yourself too much in the other’s shoes. Y ou do so to the 
extent that you find yourself always finding excuses for somebody else’s un -
derperformance or lack of understanding of your vision or the way you expect 
things to get delivered. As a result, you are always giving a lot more room than 
is required. 
“Nurturing has to be done to the extent that it enables people to become 
the finest versions of themselves, but not so much that you keep compensating 
for what they do not do or that they do not understand. 
“This has been my personal journey. I have taken refuge in not being ag -
gressive because I felt it was not me. It is not only masculine, but also something 
that I cannot be. The result has been that I was often fighting a not very articu -
late battle for what I felt should be. 
154 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
“I have found myself to be on the journey to be assertive, so that I stop giv -
ing too much rope, and this requires me to keep some distance. This is my new 
self. I wondered at first if people would not like it. But they do. A lot of people 
have told me that they see a very different me, and they like it.” (Podcast 20) 
Maybe we need to untangle empathy and kindness a bit. I don’t think em -
pathy is only love and kindness, sometimes it is about being loving and firm, 
very firm, almost bordering on unkindness but always falling just short. ‘Firm’ 
can help someone achieve something they had never in a million years thought 
they could achieve, and to do this you need empathy but also distance.
The last word on empathy and distance goes to Enaya Noor. Enaya Noor 
was the youngest person I spoke to over the year-long Expedition. She is of a 
generation that deeply associates with the word ‘empathy’: “I’m not very good 
at telling people what to do. That has always been very difficult for me, because 
I am always the one who is being told what to do.
“It is tough when people have not done their work correctly. It was ex -
tremely difficult for me to tell them because I did not want to discourage any -
one. I did not want to let anyone down. I wanted to be an empathetic boss. 
But then at the same time, the work was not being done correctly. I found it 
extremely hard to communicate to them because I had this need to be kind to 
them. “(Podcast 42) 
I urged Enaya to keep going. W e have all been there and struggle still with 
this difficult combining. Combining the next two Elements, too. Getting bur -
ied in one or the other means neither will thrive and the task will never get 
done.
Collective and Individual
I believe so deeply that building partnerships, connecting people, inspiring 
collaboration is one of women’s greatest strengths: the instinct and ability to 
convene, to bring people together. Even people who may never have done so 
before because they have history, or because they are blind to the possibility of 
combining their efforts. W omen know how to resist the pressures of compe -
tition and seek out common ground, to frame and phrase the task in a way so 
Elements | 155
that people see the opportunity and moment to come together. And we do so 
with good grace and Energy even when we ourselves do not quite believe it is 
possible.
It is an Element that is in short supply in the divided world in which 
we operate. Almost every problem we face is complex and messy and crosses 
boundaries between sectors and specialisms, geographies and generations. T o 
address them, we must cross these boundaries too. Pulling people together to 
work collectively, whether this is about drawing in colleagues from across many 
different disciplines or identifying and engaging with a wide range of partners 
and stakeholders. I have watched so many women triumph in this way. But like 
all great strengths, it can dominate and then the individual gets subsumed and 
eventually lost unless we take great care.
Collective
Latanya: “Leaders who do this are wonderful to watch. They have instincts for 
who to bring round the table. Who are the right people and from where? They 
get them together to say, ‘How can we engage? How can we partner? I think we 
can align and do things together. I think our partnership can be more than just 
a conversation.’ This Element must form part of women’s genes because you see 
so many women who have it. They have the right instincts about who to bring 
into the circle and the right relationships to persuade them to join together.” 
(Podcast 29)
There is something else in those genes, says Paula Marra, a founder of 
companies and cooperatives in Latin America: “W omen do it pragmatically. 
When we get together we don’t start talking about values. I see many, many 
collaborative processes start by trying to agree upon values, and yet people have 
different values. What they mostly share is a vision of what is better for their 
community and for humanity. It is better to focus more on that vision than 
on values. Because some people are in favour of abortion, some are not. Some 
people like organics, some do not. Some people want to be given orders, some 
do not. Setting out from the start to agree on all the values makes the process 
impossible. Society is complex and has different approaches to things. It is far 
156 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
easier to agree on what we want for the future. Just keep going and, in the end, 
values will start to emerge as you work together. At the start, remember only the 
vision and what you are achieving together. 
“In my case it is simply about planting chow. W e do not all have to agree on 
abortion rights to plant chow. W e are not evangelists; there are many times we 
have very interesting and spiritual conversations, but this does not distract us, 
and it does not mean my values are compromised, and nor are theirs. W e plant 
chow. That’s what we do together.” (Podcast 14)
Individual
W e use this collective strength in abundance, but we keep the individual front 
and centre at the same time because every individual must feel visible within the 
collective and not invisible. They must know they are heard, recognised for their 
contribution, and that whoever is leading will adapt where possible for them.
Think of Anna in her orchestra. Even as the second violin, in the second 
row, tiny (because Anna is the same height as me), Anna is visible. Or think of 
Martyna the conductor. I asked her how she makes sure everyone feels visible in 
the large collective that makes up an orchestra. 
“First you need to really place people with the right character to the right 
role, because if you settle them wrongly, they will have a constant feeling of 
being not appreciated. I think it will be fantastic never to make a mistake on 
where to put them and with whom to pair them. Y ou never can be sure that this 
time will be successful, but try to be.
“Second, you work really hard on telling them where they are and why they 
are there so that they are settled.
“Third, you make them feel appreciated, listened to, if they have a new 
idea. Y ou may have someone who always comes up with the ideas that might not 
work. Find a less prestigious concert, a less prestigious moment when you can 
afford for them to trial the idea and fulfil their needs without losing prestige.
“Fourth, know the dreams of people. I mean, someone just might need to 
play solo for a few bars, just to appear for a certain moment. It might not be very 
well played, but that moment may be what gets them up in the morning, 
Elements | 157
“Leading is to appreciate people and to place them in the right role in the 
orchestra, never to be buried in the collective.” (Podcast 45)
Uthara reached back to nature and ancestors in her Essence to illustrate 
the fierce attention she feels is needed to nurture each individual as her organ -
isation grows: “I had always been one of those people who killed a lot of pot 
plants. Then, two years back, I just told myself, ‘I got to learn this.’ I heard 
that my grandmother had a green thumb. She would just stick something in the 
earth and it would grow. So I thought genetics would show me the way. 
“Discipline played its part in my eventual success, but what it really taught 
me was patience. Y ou cannot command a plant to grow. If you give it too much 
fertiliser or water, it will die. Plants are like people. Y ou need to be around them 
and constantly nurture them and, in nurturing, you will sense when they need 
water, what impact the season is having on them, and you will adjust and change 
your leading just as a gardener does.” (Podcast 64)
How beautiful is that? W e need to collectively address the vast, messy 
problem, and this is our strength, but we must never lose sight of the individu -
als in the collective. They are beautiful plants that need fertiliser, water and air.
Quiet and Loud
Combining these two is a little different. Y ou need to flip from one to the other 
at the right moment; judging when to flip, then flip back, then flip again, and 
then revert with another flip. Y ou get the point. ‘Quiet’ is probably the right 
word, ‘loud’ is probably overdoing it, but for people who prefer quiet, it does 
sound quite loud when you flip out of quiet. 
One thing to remember is that silence and saying nothing is often quite 
‘loud’ when leading. When you stay silent as a leader, people speculate on what 
you are really thinking or not revealing, and you have little sense of what they 
are drawing from their speculations. I make this point with conviction but some 
embarrassment. I have said it to my husband repeatedly over the last forty years 
and it has had no impact. Not little impact, but no impact at all. He often cries, 
“I didn’t say anything” and my reply is, “yes, but that said it all” .
158 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Quiet 
So why quiet? T o dream, think, hear, storytell, see and interpret. Let us work 
through these.
 ▶T o dream
Gen Barr is an actress and has a very particular angle on quiet: “I am deaf, so 
being in a room full of people means I need to read lips that are this small, ” 
Gen’s finger and thumb almost touch, “and I have no capacity to predict who 
in the room is going to speak next. My hearing aids have no volume control, so 
I cannot isolate individual voices, tune them out and focus on the one that I 
want to listen to. 
“So 80% of the time, what I’m looking at is what is quiet. Body language 
and the rhythm of who likes to speak and when. It can reveal a lot about charac-
ter – sometimes more than what is being said. I am paying attention to what is 
not said. Aside from that, picking up a couple of words from here and there and 
loosely connecting them into a narrative can take me to a completely different 
place. Wildly off the mark at times, but oftentimes a creative bubble that can 
be productive. Let’s be honest, conversation can be boring and made up of de -
corum, processes and being seen to say the right thing. In a way, being deaf – 
working in the absence of sound – means I step out and take a few steps ahead. 
I can then steer the actual conversation to a positive result.”
It is a delicious concept, isn’t it? My father would tell me so often to stay 
quiet just for a moment. He would say, “switch the wireless from transmit to 
receive.” He meant that I should listen for a change. I doubt he was thinking, as 
Gen suggests, that I should dream of a better conversation. Anna the musician 
says if you listen, “sometimes you even hear the silence between the notes.”
 ▶T o think
Alison says that yoga has taught her this: “When I cannot practice my yoga – 
and sometimes you just cannot because you are too busy – I really think about it 
and think about what I am going to do when I do yoga next. In leading, we are 
human beings, not human doings. W e need to sometimes think really carefully 
Elements | 159
about what we are about to say and not just jump in and say it. Thinking about 
it can be hugely important to our effectiveness. It sets the tone before you then 
quietly speak.
“Y ou see examples in sport. Think of the football players standing on the 
field holding back on that kick as they first just think about the kick.” 
 ▶T o hear
Paula Marra feels passionately about this: “I learned so much about coopera -
tives through starting Matriarca, in Latin America. The aim was to empower 
women and it empowered me just as much. It taught me that it is very import -
ant to take the time to be quiet and listen. When I first met the women, I was 
asking questions like crazy because I was curious about their culture. It is a very 
untapped community in the middle of a region in the middle of nowhere. I 
asked questions, simple questions, and it took forever for them to reply. They 
were talking between themselves. I thought it was because I did not make my -
self clear, so I started to speak louder and faster. 
“Then one of the women said, ‘I am sorry, if you continue to ask so many 
questions, it would be very difficult for us to come to an answer.’ I realised what 
they were doing. After each question, they would talk between themselves, 
develop some ideas, and the person who knew more about what I was asking 
would then give me the answer. ‘Y ou have to give us the time to think ourselves 
and to get a consensus.’ That was the first thing I learned. That there are people 
that know a lot more about things than me, and it is nice to keep quiet, ask 
fewer questions and await their thoughts.” (Podcast 14)
After I spoke to Paula, I thought again about the expression I hear used a 
lot: the ‘radical listener.’ It sounds quite threatening. Maybe just listen and be 
‘quietly curious’ with your questions. That will do. It’s not about being radical, 
but more about being genuine and listening properly and not for show. This 
is something that upset Harriet Adong deeply when she was asked to speak at 
a global peace conference: “I was sharing my experience of bringing women 
who are survivors to peacebuilding. Even as I was talking about empowering 
women out of conflict, I was speaking for them and not with them. They were 
160 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
not invited to this peace process. So they were not given a chance to even de -
cide if they wanted to forgive or not to forgive, or if somebody should be held 
accountable or not. Everyone at the conference wanted to be seen to be hearing; 
they were loud about their listening, but it was for show. They did not really 
want to hear the voices of the survivors.” (Podcast 6)
 ▶T o storytell
Melissa Berman, who has backed some of the most interesting social entrepre -
neurs across the world, says, “The best storytellers are always the best listeners. 
In the oral tradition, they learn their stories from listening to others because 
nothing is written down. They do not see themselves as the creators of the story, 
just the vessels of a story that belongs to everybody.  
“This helps when you lead. If you listen to and engage with the voices of 
the people around you, and if you listen to the fairy tales of their culture, those 
fairy tales, folk tales and legends hold truths about that culture – and not just 
the old ones, but the new ones too. Be sure to listen to the stories behind the 
most popular songs and of the musicians who perform them. Then you find out 
why they are so powerful.
“ All this gives you a kind of authenticity that becomes extremely powerful. 
Y ou can tell the story. Y ou understand the imagined, potential or actual audi-
ence, and can tell a story in a way that will resonate with them. It is physical and 
it is visceral. It is not just about the head and the heart, but the gut too, the full 
body. It is the ability to turn it from ‘the’ story or ‘their’ story to ‘our’ story. In 
doing so, you change the narratives.
“This is a critical feature of how women lead. It provides an opportunity to 
build successful movements that might bring about change with less fighting. It 
is a skill that emerges from being quiet and listening, the ability to describe and 
understand the protagonists, what their story is and, crucially, why should the 
listener have empathy with the protagonist? How their story connects to my 
own life that helps me understand their life.” (Podcast 30)
Helena Kennedy, a barrister who has campaigned on behalf of women all 
through her life, agrees: “It’s all about being able to tell the story if you are go -
Elements | 161
ing to make a compelling case for what you are doing and why you are doing it. 
People are being asked for things all the time. Y ou have to remind people what 
is involved and why it is important.” (Podcast 29)
 ▶T o see
Someone over the length of the Expedition – I cannot, however hard I try, re -
member who it was – said something wonderful to me: “If someone says or does 
something that seems strange to you or that you disagree with, ask yourself: is it 
because they see less than I see, or is it that they see more than I see?” 
Anna’s expression, “the silence between the notes” is compelling. Maybe 
in the silence, we find what others see. The silences often reveal more than the 
words. For Anna, it is between musical notes, but the idea translates. 
Vivi T ellas, as a theatre director, says it does: “When we direct, we tend 
to look at the figures on the stage, the main characters, but if we have two peo -
ple, what I watch for is the space between them, because what is in between 
them may be invisible and quiet, but it is more interesting and often creates the 
drama.” (Podcast 31)
 ▶T o interpret
W ords can reduce a message to a simplicity that is not there. They can confuse, 
especially in the retelling, and above all they are absolutely not up to the chal -
lenge of translation. W e have to somehow reduce our over-reliance on words 
and instead leave time to digest and share understanding.
It was creating podcast episode forty that illustrated this for me, when I 
asked the members of the First Expedition to translate the definition of leader -
ship we had all agreed on into their mother tongues. 
The episode ended up with twelve women and twelve languages. Can I 
please recommend that you listen to it? I cannot capture it for you on paper, but 
here are some of the things they said:
“I need to find an old Chinese poem or saying to represent the meaning.”
“That means something very different in Creole.” 
“Y ou can have a literal translation, or we can use personification.”
162 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
“So that is my translation, but it doesn’t mean much.”
“’Catalysing’ in Greek can mean the opposite to what it means in English.”
“When you use that word on its own it’s fine, but when it is surrounded by 
other words the meaning changes.”
“ As a scientist, ‘catalyse’ means something very different.”
“In Polish, ‘catalysing’ mostly refers to speed.” 
“Maybe, maybe, we can try. No, that will not work.”
“’Momentum’ is a very formal and strong word in Arabic.”
“In Bangla, that means a blending of the flavours.”
“I found it! I found it! In Chinese with this poem, it becomes simple but 
classic and very very beautiful.”
“I have got it in Bahasa. When you listen, it sounds so beautiful. I have 
been thinking, I do too much in English. I like my native Bahasa more. I don’t 
feel nervous in Bahasa.” 
Afterwards I asked Uma how she felt about English. “I don’t resent it, but 
there are times when I feel a little disappointed that my native language is not 
something that I have been able to weave into aspects of my life. At the same 
time, the English language helps me to connect to millions of others. I owe so 
much of friendship and wisdom to it. Having said that, if there was more space 
for two languages to be able to flow into each other, able to weave and be used 
together, it would be ideal.”
Ana Luz agrees: “English brings connection and it is a gift. But it needs to 
be wielded with awareness and we must be mindful that what we say in English 
may be perceived very differently by others.” (Podcast 40)
Using words with care calls for a lot of quiet to be around them.
Loud
So when does leading require us to slide into loud in the moment and at the 
right moment? Because a decision has been made and needs briefing, some -
thing needs challenging, a question demands an answer, a message needs to be 
communicated or, quite simply, because leading requires us to be visible.
Elements | 163
 ▶T o brief
Liz: “Sometimes a situation will demand careful listening and extensive consul -
tation, and sometimes it doesn’t. It requires decisive action by the person who 
is leading, and it must be communicated well. There are times when there has 
to be absolute clarity on the direction and the instructions must remove any 
doubt. Y ou are not inviting discussion.” I asked Liz how she had felt in such cir -
cumstances. “I know that in these times – and you have to judge them carefully 
– people crave relatively loud and one-way messages.”  
 ▶T o challenge
Jacqui: “Leading means challenging pretty much all the time. W e must be al -
lowed to do it differently from men, but we must actually do it. W e have to resist 
the temptation to seek the calmness of everyone being happy. And we must 
resist the temptation to agree when it is false and stop nodding and smiling and 
keeping quiet. It is not really about being loud. W e can do it quietly. But even 
when we do it quietly, it will sound loud. I have always said, on the day I die, I 
will be in my coffin saying, ‘just one more thing before you put the lid down.’” 
(Podcast 27) 
Mai agrees: “There is never going to be the right time to challenge. There 
will always be some who will fight you. Half of them will do so because they 
underestimate you, the other half because they are frightened of you. 
“Y ou will be told that you simply have to challenge the right way. But there 
is no right way, and it is never the right time. Sometimes you just have to do 
it. Prepare yourself, prepare your words, make sure that you are well briefed, 
anticipate what will trigger you, get yourself under control and strike first if you 
can. If you wait until the end, they will see you coming and may well cut you off  
and silence you. Above all, expect pushback from the ones who do not want you 
to speak too loudly as they benefit from the status quo, and remember that all 
major change is created by people speaking out.” 
164 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
 ▶T o question
When I met Meera Baindur, a scholar in India, I asked her why she had decided 
to give up being a guru. “I found that part of the guru’s role was to answer ques-
tions and solve people’s problems, yet I felt that people could solve their own 
problems. What I needed to do was to ask them the right questions so that they 
could figure out the answers themselves. 
“It was thinking about Gargi in the Hindu writings that persuaded me to 
become an academic instead. Gargi did not teach wisdom; she just let students 
shine by asking them the right questions. She offered no solutions, did not write 
any great treatises or produce lengthy commentaries. She just asked questions. 
“I began to realise that, as a guru, I was not following Gargi’s approach. I 
was trying to solve people’s problems. 
“The trouble is that people do not expect gurus to ask questions. They 
want answers. I began to fear that the whole point of the guru seemed to be 
making your disciples dependent on you. I had figured out that everybody is a 
light unto themselves. So I became a philosophy teacher instead, loudly asking 
questions all the time. Even when I am on a bus.” (Podcast 22) 
 ▶T o say no
Think back to Erica’s advice on deciding on a promotion: “It is your journey, 
no one else’s. Do not live in somebody else’s profile of you. When people say, 
‘you have been nominated, ’ or ‘you are being put forward for this, ’ you may feel 
honoured, but do not bow to the tremendous pressure to say yes. 
“Do not worry about what they will say. Just say no loud enough so that 
they hear.” (Podcast 10) 
This resonated with me so much. I am clear that sometimes you must 
loudly and against all advice say no. I remember my first boss saying to me, “I 
don’t pay you to say yes. W e know that the people around you will not need to 
wait for you to say yes. What I do pay you for is occasionally to say no and to 
say it loudly and infrequently enough so that the people around you will hear 
and stop.”
Elements | 165
 ▶T o be visible
Of course, you do not always have to be loud to be visible, but you do some -
times. Never forget that leading means occasionally standing firmly, loudly and 
clearly so that you are heard. I have done many speeches in my life, but the ones 
that always terrified me, that stopped me in my tracks with nerves, were the 
ones to my colleagues, the people I lead. 
What a mistake it is when you see chief executives attend the major staff  
gatherings of their organisations and stay silent. They don’t stand up to thank 
or to encourage, to remind people of the purpose or to paint a picture of the 
future. They pass on the opportunity to share the vision, to build the commit -
ment, to make people feel inspired. If it’s the public speaking skills that hold 
them back, they can learn them, watch others, practice and keep going until 
they have acquired them. If it’s humility that holds them back, then they need 
to overcome it.
This must surely be even more important in today’s world. Back to Claire: 
“It is changing at a terrifying speed, and people in power are not giving suffi-
cient explanations, sufficient assurances about what the changes mean for peo -
ple’s livelihoods, security of jobs, families, opportunities.” (Podcast 38) 
I hear you say, “but we don’t know the answers, ” but remember that silence 
is the worst option. Silence will lead people to think about the worst possible 
scenario and assume that you are not speaking to them because it’s likely to 
happen.
‘Loud’ may indeed not be quite the right word, but it will feel shockingly 
loud the first time you visibly brief, challenge, question or say no. And it prob -
ably always will. 
And quiet is the wrong word too. Maybe it is about having the quiet, the 
space and the humility to genuinely listen to what people are saying and to hold 
back before quietly speaking. Not to listen for what you want to hear or to find 
the thing that is going to confirm that you were always right. It is really being quiet 
so that you understand what the situation is and what people need from you.
 So we combine the two: just quiet enough to hear or, as my father would 
say, “Switch the wireless from transmit to receive.” Liz believes that it is this 
166 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
combination of quiet and loud that is the joy of leading: “When you look into 
someone’s eyes and have enough of a relationship with them that you can sense 
what is needed in that moment.” 
Vulnerable and Strong
Unlike quiet and loud, there is no flipping these. It has to be both and at the 
same time; you have to be strong enough to be vulnerable and vulnerable 
enough to be strong. 
Mistakes
Combining the two feels very tied to making mistakes and how to deal with 
them when you do. Because if you get it right when you do, you can often turn 
a situation around.
Luseshelo Simwinga, a midwife in Malawi, illustrates: “I was on midwifery 
night duty. W e had a woman who was in labour. Her baby was going into foetal 
distress. W e called the operating theatre team to come, but then we did not have 
fuel in the hospital car to get them to us. W e asked to use the boss’s car because 
it had fuel, but we were told it was only in service of the boss. By the time the 
operating theatre team arrived, the woman had lost her baby in uterus. 
“In the morning I went to the boss and confronted him. He was quick to 
say, ‘I am very sorry that happened. From now onwards, you can use my car 
whenever you need it.’ That gave me a lot of respect for him, that he can say 
sorry to subordinates.” 
Looking back, Luseshelo had expected him to hold on to his car at any price 
and she had certainly not expected him to reveal even an ounce of vulnerability. 
“But he showed me vulnerability by apologising and strength by apologis-
ing. It disarmed me. For me personally, most bosses bring out aggressiveness and 
defensiveness in me, but as soon as I realised that he was leading and not bossing, 
I became a good subordinate. I became defenceless. Because I said to myself, ‘I 
am glad to work under him and to follow what he wants.’” (Podcast 28)
Elements | 167
Honest
The combination of vulnerability and strength also ties into honesty. Helena 
says, “I have spent my life in courtrooms. It has developed an instinct in me. 
Witnesses are brought to the court, and before I stand up to cross examine 
them, I watch them very carefully. It is almost as if I can smell it in the court -
room when someone is going to tell the truth or when they will dissemble and 
deny or reach easily for a lie. I just know it.
“I think this is an important lesson. If you want to lead, you have to re -
ally be honest, and that means be vulnerable about your failures and be strong 
enough to learn from the times when you get things wrong. Y ou have to be 
truthful when you feel fear or worry or when you have made the wrong call. 
People prefer that to overconfidence and the denial of any frailty.” (Podcast 29)
Rouba agrees, but warns not to go too far: “It is very important to be vul -
nerable sometimes and to show that you are human, but don’t forget that it’s 
not always vulnerability people crave from you, but also strength. They look 
to you to make them believe in themselves and the future. And you have to re -
member that one strong word from you has a lot of power.” (Podcast 10)
This combining of apparent opposing versions of you can sometimes be -
come worrying to the people around you. Stephanie says it is why you must take 
the time to explain your apparent dual personality.
Stephanie herself is a good example. She is known as deeply kind and 
generous but, when she goes into a negotiation meeting, she is the toughest of 
negotiators and far from vulnerable. People around her seem surprised, even 
recoil when they see it, maybe even question her authenticity. But there is no 
inconsistency – she is a tough fighter for the things she cares deeply about.
This is why, if we are leading, we must explain ourselves. But even in this, 
we need to take care and ask ourselves all the time just how much is really help -
ful. It can tip into confession or even abdication too early. Hearing too much 
sometimes risks undermining people’s strength to keep going.
168 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Hopeful
Leila picks up on this theme: “More often than not, leading is about being 
strong and hopeful even when you are not feeling either. Granted, hope can 
vary in degrees. In situations like being in a refugee camp or tackling immensely 
challenging problems, your hope may never reach a hundred percent. However, 
leading involves acknowledging that there is always a kernel of hope. For if you 
become hopeless, apathetic to the cause and disengaged, those around you will 
follow suit. Even if hope is as low as two percent, there are moments when you 
must confront the severity of the situation, acknowledge formidable barriers 
and not overlook the lack of progress. Somehow you have to acknowledge vul -
nerability honestly but still strive to find that two percent of hope. 
“During challenging times, it becomes vital to purposefully seek out these 
almost daily moments of hope. W e should not solely focus on grand achieve -
ments but also find inspiration in the small things as they have the power to 
evoke awe and wonder. These small moments sustain hope, and they gradually 
emanate from others within the team too. 
“T o lead a fight, you cannot be the only person instilling optimism and 
hope on the long journey. It is important to foster an environment where others 
in the team also become champions of hope.” (Podcast 36) 
Harriet Adong reflects on the role of that smile in combining vulnerability 
and strength. When she gets a smile in return to hers, it tells her one of two 
things: “Sometimes it is a smile of pain, and sometimes it is a smile of anger. 
Neither is a real smile. When it is anger, it is, ‘Why did this happen to me?’ It is 
a smile of hate, regret, the feeling of not being able to put anything into words. 
“ And then there is a third a smile, of relief. It says, ‘I am happy and happy 
to talk, because I have reached my moment of healing.’”
I ask Harriet about the original smile, the one that came from her, that 
elicited this smile in return.
“Mine is a smile that builds a culture of peace. That says, ‘you can always 
connect with me. Y ou should not be scared to reach out to me.’ It creates the 
culture of connection. Y ou have to hold onto that smile whatever you are going 
Elements | 169
through. Most times, we do not want to bring out and speak of our vulnerabil -
ity, but if we smile, we can connect with our vulnerability without words.  
“It creates hope with those that I work with. If I don’t give it, the survivors 
will lose their belief that something new can happen to them. Y ou have to do 
this even if your heart is breaking inside. Even in your darkest time, as a leader, 
you have to create that smile, even when you do not feel like smiling.
“It is the smile of vulnerability, but the very fact that you can smile sends a 
message of strength. When things around seem very dark, you have to hold on 
and people have to see you holding on. They say, ‘If she is not broken, if she is 
keeping positive, if she is still smiling even in the dark times, then I think we can 
still also hold on and give her the support she needs.’ 
“Sometimes, I tell them, I look strong but I am not that strong. Of course, 
they do not really hear me. Their looks say, ‘Do not give up, do not give up.’ I do 
have a sort of innocent belief that somehow we will make it work, that things 
will come good.” (Podcast 18)
As you read Harriet’s words, I have no doubt that you can feel her combin -
ing and living the two: vulnerability and strength. Olivia thinks it is almost a 
superhuman combination: “Leaders somehow have to muster this Energy, and 
when they do it creates a sort of magic. Even if it is just about being happy with 
their job and enthusiastic about what they are doing. Because the Energy trans-
mits to the people around them if they are positive, optimistic and believe in 
what they are doing – or at least if they can hide the fears enough so that people 
have this feeling that it is magic, what we are doing together.” (Podcast 42)
Dogged and Agile
The world is moving fast and as leaders we must move fast too. Y esterday might 
give insights on tomorrow, but only insights. Change is everywhere and its speed 
is compounding. So we have to be agile, but at the same time dogged enough to 
see change through. W e have to flip in an instant from agile to dogged and then 
back again. T o think again, try something new, stand under a shower as Rachel 
suggested; if it doesn’t work today, it might work tomorrow. Have crazy ideas 
and test them. If they work, do them more. If they don’t, stop, apologise and 
170 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
rethink. Follow our instincts. Say no sometimes. Question the data. Use all our 
human skills. And then pace ourselves; don’t give up, keep going.
Dogged
W omen seldom give up. It comes from our Essence. W e decide to stop, for sure, 
to regroup, but keep moving.
Hatoon Alfassi, a scholar from Saudi Arabia who has led some brave cam -
paigns, tells me that women have never been inclined to give up. Her inspira -
tion in this is Hagar in the sacred texts: “Hagar was abandoned with her child 
in the middle of the desert without food or shelter. She did not sit still, even 
though she was sure that God was by her side. She did not just stay waiting for 
a table of food to come down from the sky. She was in Makka, which lay in the 
middle of nowhere. It was then a barren place, the heat was unbearable. And 
when the rain came down, which was rare, it flooded. Surviving with her little 
child in such an environment without breaking down was remarkable and re -
quired courage, determination and intelligence. 
“She inspires me to keep on going. I try not to concentrate on the past 
or on what might bring me down. I think this is what she did. She went on 
building her life step by step. I reach the small dreams ahead of me and each day 
leads to another. I hope that I have some of her courage and resilience. I keep 
reflecting on her story. I think that there are always ways; the small lamp that 
shines from her story brightens my sad times. 
“ And I remind myself that she eventually became a free woman, head of 
her household, leader of her own town, a matriarch of a people and of a faith. 
“(Podcast 23) 
Uma’s grandmother gave her a poem: “In difficult times, you move forward 
in small steps. Do what you have to do, but little by little. Do not think about 
the future, or what may happen tomorrow. W ash the dishes. Remove the dust. 
W rite a letter. Make a soup. Y ou see? Y ou are advancing step by step. T ake a step 
and stop. Rest a little. Praise yourself. T ake another step. Then another. Y ou will 
not notice, but your steps will grow more and more. And the time will come 
when you can think about the future without crying.” 
Elements | 171
What is the secret to such doggedness, I asked Julienne Lusenge, who 
fights on behalf of women in the Congo. Because there must be moments when 
even Julienne is tempted to give up. “T o alter the lives for women in the Congo 
requires stamina. One day I decided, ‘now I think that I need to stop because 
nothing’s happened. No result, no success, no change and no change is coming.’ 
I was tired, always tired, so I told my family I was stopping, and they said, ‘we 
will see.’ 
“Soon after, I was in a car going from Kinshasa to Mombasa and I saw 
police being aggressive to a woman. I said ‘stop’ to the driver. I got outside and 
asked the woman what was happening. She explained that these police had ar -
rested the husband. He had done nothing. Now the police were asking her for 
money. I asked the commander of the police to explain to me what the law 
was. I called the prosecutor in Benny and told him the story and he sorted the 
problem. 
“I got back into the car and my husband said, ‘you start again?’ And I say, 
‘can you think that I can just leave this situation and go?’ So my husband and I 
and the driver continued to Mombasa. 
“In some of the fights I have fought, I get so caught up that I forget to go 
and spend enough time with the people I am fighting for. And if I don’t, I sort 
of forget and I begin to get tired. When I meet them, it gives me Energy. They 
tell me their story. Some stories are very painful, but some make me happy.” 
(Podcast 36)
Agile
Melissa Kwee tells me what she sees as the secret to her agility: divergent think -
ing or, as she puts it, zagging: “Leading is about being a prophet for an alterna -
tive future and hopefully a better one; one that is glimpsed but does not yet ex -
ist. Often it is very different – if not the opposite – from what we see around us.  
“I was once trying to choose the right creative agency for some work. I 
walked into this one place, and they had a big poster in their entrance. It was 
of a whole bunch of white sheep walking in one direction and then one black 
sheep walking in the opposite direction. The caption read, ‘when the world zigs 
172 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
– you zag.’ I chose that agency because there is not enough zagging going on. It 
is not rewarded enough or protected enough. 
“Y ou have to lead so that your team never stops zagging. There have to be 
proponents of the zag. They have to be almost appointed ‘ Apostles of the Zag’ 
because it is too difficult if it is only one person’s job. Y ou need people to cover 
each other’s backs. Y ou almost need a network of zaggers disrupting each other 
at speed.” (Podcast 69)
W e know what Alia would recommend they do: play. “Because it allows us 
to build trust with one another, find fulfilment, develop our brains and deepen 
our creativity. T o become more emotionally attuned to one another’s needs and 
to step back and see problems from a new light, both of which are critical as-
pects of agile leading. W e can shift the Energy in a room using play and even 
overturn a power differential and flip a hierarchy. 
“Of course, one snag is that play is received differently in different cultural 
contexts. In some cultures, people are hesitant to participate in any activities 
where they could ‘win’ when playing with their managers.  It takes time and 
work to cultivate a safe space where the hierarchy and power differential can 
be dismantled so that people can play freely and be agile without thought of 
workplace dynamics.” 
I love to play too, and know the eternal risk you run of being told to ‘stop 
being silly’ or ‘grow up.’ I remember being told off in a lift one day. My colleagues 
and I worked on the top floor. Other leaders in the building found it strange and 
perhaps embarrassing that we were always laughing – sometimes giggling – in 
the lift. This made us seem not serious, or perhaps it made our neighbours seem 
too serious. Who knows, but the word ‘unprofessional’ was used. I thought how 
sad that to appear professional you must be serious, maybe even boring. They 
asked me to request less laughing from my colleagues; I didn’t. I couldn’t have.
Alia laughed at this: “I was regularly given advice or reviews about the ways 
they  felt I could become more ‘effective.’ T o cut my hair, wear darker colours and 
boxier clothing, lower my voice, square my shoulders, limit my hand gestures, 
be less friendly and smile less. More serious and less playful.” (Podcast 8)
Elements | 173
Vivi suffers in the same way: “ As a young theatre director, I soon realised 
that people think that leading is a serious affair. T o lead you must be certain, 
strong and have a booming voice. I have chosen uncertain, fragile and playful. 
They all make me more creative and agile. But it is not always easy, especially 
because I need my backers to trust me. 
“Y et how could I possibly be a creative theatre director without being 
childish? Because I am very childish. I have this personality and I have to work 
with it. And from it comes my ideas, my creativity, my agility and my ability 
to relate to others. I have a childish curiosity and if it is not satisfied, I am not 
interested and I stop doing anything. I still have my very little voice which does 
not sound like a theatre director’s voice. But it is.” 
I asked Vivi if ‘childish’ was really the right word. “Maybe it is just being 
irresponsible. Like a child, I am always playing, and I do not think too much 
about consequences. For me the work in art is to be open to things we do not 
know and have the agility to respond to them.” (Podcast 31)
Olivia Grobocopatel offers a suggestion from her frustrated next genera -
tion: allow rule breaking: “Encourage people to do things that are not in their 
job descriptions and do not let others block ideas even when they do not fit. 
T oo often we see a job through a job description. The employer uses it to put 
boundaries up and the employee uses it as a defence mechanism. 
“I think my generation will find a way to break down job descriptions, 
make them more open, even add in that one third of the time should be spent 
exploring new ideas. Let us build in agility to our systems and our cultures.” 
(Podcast 42)
Roll on Olivia’s generation. 
Allyson Nicholson, who leads supply chain management at Moderna, says 
agility lies in curiosity and that it should be allowed to rule: “I like to be busy. 
It keeps me out of trouble. And I am very busy. I always have more things to 
accomplish in a day than I could ever do. I like a challenge. In a situation of 
a panic or chaos, you would want me with you. I realise that the objective of 
supply chain management is tidiness and the smooth flowing of water. But the 
stream never flows beautifully; there are rocks, there is chaos, there is dirt and 
174 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
pipes and rubbish in the way. It is not that I love the chaos, but I love sort -
ing it. Constantly finding which way is up and which way is not. Like Alice in 
W onderland, we need to decide what path is the right one.
“I think this is why supply chain management benefits from having women 
involved. W e are more open to quickly pivot and find the potential solution 
that might require more collaboration between groups. And we do things that 
have not been done before because we are willing to speak up and propose the 
things that are not obvious at the first sight.”
Aparna says that the agility breakthrough comes when you see that “life is 
cyclical and not linear. It is not just a direct climb up the stairs. Y ou go up and 
come down and go around and pick yourself or someone else up. That is what 
agile leading is to me, simply being able and willing to adapt and drop every -
thing for the people around you. Y ou cannot stay fixed. There are times when 
you have to be more humble or less humble, more strong or less strong, more 
vulnerable or less vulnerable. I love the combining idea.” (Podcast 51) 
For me, the breakthrough came when I realised that you could move 
around and lead from different positions, from the middle, the front, the back 
and the sides. Y ou move to where you are needed and are most effective. Perhaps 
most importantly, you can move to the front when it is needed, but only when 
it is needed and only for as long as it is needed. Y ou have to be ready to do so 
at all times; whether it is to get things back on track, to move things forward 
faster, to take the flack, to remind people of the vision, to spot what is ahead, to 
generate Energy visibly from the front. But when you do go out front, it is with 
the clear intention of stepping back as soon as possible.
Y ou must also be prepared to lead from the back, when you are hardly 
needed because things are flowing almost without you. Let us be clear that you 
are not back there because you are hiding; that is not leading. Nor are you back 
there because it is a collaboration; they require very active leading and some -
times even from right out in front.
Or you may need to lead from the sides, because you may need to deploy 
quickly but it is best to keep out of the way just for now.
Elements | 175
Then there is leading from the middle, where you can see everyone, sense 
movement, taste the air, feel the vibrations, love everyone, delight in the tri-
umphs, hold hands, giggle together, watch for shifts, smell the risks and spot 
the moments. 
I think I have revealed my favourite place to be. I know that I will always 
find Paula Marra there too, in the middle where “you feel that sparkle that you 
cannot describe. Ideas are everywhere with no idea who from.” (Podcast 14)
But, however much I love the middle, I will pivot to the front, the back 
and the sides with agility and without a moment’s hesitation, moving positions 
doggedly, inching forwards as we go. I think agile and dogged are starting to 
merge, though I am not sure. T oo dogged and you remain suboptimal, too agile 
and you may run out of steam.
Inclusive and Boundaries
Every one of our seven pieces of Essence, from motherness to education, formed 
the roots of a common element: inclusive. The word dominates. But even it 
has another element to combine with, and strangely one which appears quite 
incongruous: boundaries.
Inclusive
I asked Selvie to start us off by reminding us of what it feels like to be included. 
Selvie has been on the receiving end of non-inclusive leading, when she felt 
barely tolerated: “The leader sent a message: ‘I care about myself and you are 
under me, therefore you need to do the things that I ask you to do. If you do not 
deliver, then you fail. If you fail to deliver something, then I am here to remind 
you that you did not do what you should for our team.’ Most of the time I had 
no precise idea on what ‘the things’ even were.”
And she has also experienced the opposite, which she encountered when 
she moved jobs and got a new boss: “I suddenly felt like my leader cared about 
me as a person. What surprised me the most was realising that my opinion was 
valued, even though I might not know much. The love and the forgiveness took 
me unawares too. When I committed a mistake, I was forgiven for committing 
176 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
it and even encouraged to take a look at why it happened. I felt like we were on 
the same team, in the same boat. There was alignment of interests. It was very 
nurturing. 
“I smile when I think about how different it is now. When I am asked to 
do work, I want to finish it because I really want my team to do well. In the past 
I might have said, ‘I need to finish this work because if I do not complete it my 
boss will give me a very bad review.’ Now, leading is something that motivates 
me internally. I am part of it, and it makes me want to stay.” (Podcast 7) 
There are so many more grim daily accounts of deep prejudice and absence 
of inclusivity, of cultures in which Selvie would not have even got an inter -
view for either of the roles she describes. Accounts of injustice and bigotry, of 
missed opportunities and squandered talent, of suboptimal, homogenous teams 
delivering reliable group think, of people leading who do not put inclusivity 
as a priority or who make sure that it absolutely isn’t. And even if inclusivity is 
introduced into the systems, diverse talent is so often then met by leaders who 
are hostile, ignorant, careless or self-centred. 
W e know that the prize for inclusive leading is people such as Selvie de -
scribing her job with such commitment. There is, however, a long way to go to 
get to the prize. Martyna says it is not easy even with the will to be inclusive be -
cause so many people have become accustomed to the opposite: “In many parts 
of the world, it is not what people have been programmed for. As a conductor 
you know that to produce a beautiful piece of music you need the intellectual 
and emotional  engagement from all the players, but you cannot find a way to 
do it. Y ou have to break through this barrier that has been put up in some cul -
tures where people have no experience of inclusivity. The barrier has written on 
it, ‘I am untouched. I will do something with my hands, but you cannot have my 
head or my heart.’ People have switched off; their bodies are still doing the task, 
but their hearts and minds are not there. They are empty.
“I have seen this in many countries. I call them feudal countries because 
that is the mentality. People do not involve themselves intellectually or emo -
tionally because freedom has not been given to them. They have just had to 
obey. If they do not agree with the oppressor, withdrawing their emotions and 
Elements | 177
intellect is their only way of showing this. The rest of it they do with the hands. 
Their heads and hearts disapprove; they keep them to themselves.
“This mentality is rooted deep. So when you lead, you must overcome it. 
Break in with a new light, a new stream of hope. Somehow you have to instil 
that you as the person leading are not the enemy. This is not easy. For centuries, 
people have not felt equal because the leader has been the oppressor.
“This feudal mentality exists everywhere – not just in orchestras and not 
just in my part of the world. It is the challenge of leading, not to be the enemy 
and to persuade people to bring their whole selves to the task.” (Podcast 45)
For such a breakthrough on inclusive leading to happen, Catherine and 
T erri suggest that two myths about inclusivity need busting: the meritocracy 
myth and the melting pot myth.
First the meritocracy myth, which makes Catherine despair: “In many or -
ganisations, many ambitious people have a stake in believing in it. The trouble is 
that it is not a meritocracy, there is no level playing field and, in fact, it is a very 
uneven playing field.
“This myth does so much damage. T oo many people have fallen for it. The 
result is that women think that if they don’t succeed at something, it is their in -
dividual fault. And men see very few women around and conclude that women 
must not be good enough to get in.
“Challenging the myth gives you a hard time because the people that have 
made it in the meritocracy obviously believe in it; they think the system works. 
So if you start challenging it, you are challenging their value and that is not 
going to get you very far in climbing the ladder.
“I think, in order to really make a difference, you have to not care about 
climbing the ladder, and it is only with privilege that you can do this. If you 
don’t need the job then you can challenge, but if you really need it, it is really 
hard to do any challenging. I think this is more true the more you do not fit the 
mould. In effect, the more you are a marginalized group the harder it is to chal -
lenge, and the more you are part of the majority group the easier it is.
“So the myth continues and, in my world, women keep on being told they 
have to promote themselves to get on in this glorious meritocracy. Basically, ‘fit 
in, play the game and you will rise.’ But you won’t. It’s a myth.” (Podcast 33)
178 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
The second, the myth of what T erri calls the “quote-unquote melting pot” , 
causes her to despair too: “What it actually does is distil away all that is uniquely 
‘you.’ W omen can get caught up in this whole myth.  
“When I think of the relationships that I have with women in the United 
States – White Hispanic, Asian, African-American – we are each from our own 
places in American society, trying to carve out not only our identities but how 
we are moving through time and space and how we even connect with one an -
other. W e do not want to play games as to whose oppression is the worst or most 
restrictive. One thing we have in common is that our society has made us feel 
deficient and devalued because we are not white. It applies to every woman of 
colour in the US by nature of our skin colour, hair texture, sometimes our ac-
cent and what kind of dress we choose to wear, because race and class intersect 
in the US.
“W e just have to start thinking about what really matters, how we value hu -
manity and even how we value differences of opinion. Difference simply cannot 
be made deficient, because that is at the heart of racism and it is a stain that the 
US still needs to name, own, understand and work to repair. 
“The melting pot mentality does not help. How I even move in the US as 
a Black woman is very different to my college colleagues. Some of my white fe -
male colleagues have an advantage in how they move through the world simply 
because of the American construct that allows white women to assume a place 
of supremacy. I have to assimilate, to give up everything that makes me who I 
am in order to be accepted as American. There is a certain form of almost white -
ness that I must clothe myself in. There are certain kinds of music I should listen 
to so that I am seen as ‘cultured.’ But I will not ‘melt, ’ whether it is pretending to 
like opera so as to fit in with people in power or pretending I do not like opera 
(which I do) to fit in with women of colour.
“If only we could get beyond this notion that somehow women of colour 
are deficient and ‘not your sisters, ’ only then could we unite and advocate for 
a healthier society for us all. But for now, the spectre of racism that stains and 
plagues us continues even to the point where it divides women who should be 
natural allies.” 
Elements | 179
After speaking to Catherine and T erri, I offer a third myth. I spent a year 
writing a book on CQ, or cultural intelligence. There is too much emphasis on 
IQ – helpful but only first base – and on EQ – important but often limited 
to ‘leading people like me’ – and I have become convinced that we need more 
emphasis on CQ – or ‘leading people not like me’ – if we are ever to reach 
inclusivity. I spoke to people from different generations, geographies, sectors, 
specialisms, backgrounds and beliefs as I wrote the book. Almost everyone I 
spoke to thought that CQ began with ‘walking in other people’s shoes.’ They 
spoke about seeing difference differently and some talked of ‘cracking other 
cultures.’ It had become formulaic. One woman I met had been on a course to 
understand Chinese culture before taking on a big new role; she had been told 
all about how to hand over a business card in China, holding it out with both 
hands and bowing over it. Unfortunately, the first person she met in China had 
also been on a course to understand W estern culture; she had been told that it 
was crucial to establish eye contact from the start with W esterners. When they 
met, they almost knocked each other out.
I don’t mean to ridicule with this story, and such courses are without doubt 
helpful, but to really develop CQ you have to overcome this myth that you 
must focus on other cultures when in fact it is your own culture that needs the 
focus, so that you see when your own culture helps you to understand others 
and when it does the very opposite. It gives you blind spots which you have to 
address if you want to be inclusive as you lead.
Ayesha agrees wholeheartedly, and says it is a very long and tough journey: 
“I have been steeped in that scholarly work around inclusivity for years, but I re -
peatedly find myself harsh towards none other than myself and my own culture. 
In being receptive and curious about the ‘other’ culture that I am learning from, 
I lose sight of my own. I fall victim to conscious and unconscious biases in my 
own self, my own heritage, my cultural nuances and the impact of internalised 
colonialism and patriarchy on me. I urge every woman who leads to go through 
a journey of self-reflection and to, as much as possible, courageously confront 
our own biases about and towards ourselves.”
180 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Ayesha then goes a step further: “W e have to be inclusive to ourselves be -
fore we can hope to be inclusive to others.” This resonates with Ana Luz: “I 
have come to see my multi-cultural identity as rich and full of complementary 
dimensions. Now I embrace its contradictions, but it was not always this way 
and it is not always easy. I embrace my multi-dimensional identity now. I ac-
knowledge it, own it and make it explicit.”
In acknowledging, we also recognise that it will come with blind spots too. 
Even if we perceive ourselves as inclusive, there will be people whom we come 
across less and people who confuse us more, and we will not always meet our as-
piration to be inclusive. There will be people whom we openly or subtly bench -
mark against ourselves, judging them as quicker or slower, more or less fun, 
more or less intelligent, more or less fair-skinned, even more or less inclusive 
than me, with ‘Me’ too easily becoming the benchmark. 
 Inclusivity requires us to break away from this way of thinking. Having 
firmly decided that we are not the benchmark against which to judge others as 
lesser or more. It was one of my proudest days when T erri, whom I admire so 
very much as a Black woman in the US taking vast challenges head-on, adopted 
as hers the expression, “I am not the benchmark.”
But why, then, does inclusivity need combining, and how could boundar -
ies possibly be the element it needs to be combined with?
Boundaries
Sometimes inclusive is seen as holding an open space with no boundaries – ev -
eryone feels included and able to fill the space as they wish. It makes sense in 
some ways, and it is truly important that the space is open but not that it has 
no boundaries. 
Sometimes, in leading, we beautifully include all, and then in the name of 
inclusivity let all do anything. W e justify a lack of boundaries in the name of 
inclusivity. I hand over to Uthara and Alia to explain.
Uthara: “I did finally realise that I was expecting everybody to be just like 
me. So how I lead had become almost as if I was leading myself. 
Elements | 181
“I believed in complete freedom being given because I was committed to 
‘leading inclusively and democratically.’ I would sit everybody down and deci-
sions would never be made because we would keep going round and round.
“I finally got it. A blank sheet of paper to draw whatever you want is not 
what everybody likes. Many want structure, to be led. It was a like slap in the 
face.” (Podcast 64) 
Alia picks up from this point: “Providing limitless space to teams can 
actually be problematic and far from empowering or inclusive. It can even be 
harmful. Leading is about offering people a space where they feel safe, which 
means providing clarity on the parameters. Only then do people feel empow -
ered and able to do great work. I’ve found that unlimited space for creativity 
can be paralysing.”
I asked Alia if she had always seen it this way. “ A hundred percent I did 
not. I used to think that the fewer the boundaries, the more liberating it would 
be. Now I see a container as deeply liberating. For me to thrive, I need to know 
boundaries for my own sense of safety, structure, direction. It’s helpful to know 
the mission, what’s in scope and out of scope. This can actually be generative 
and give me space to run with clarity. For me, this is deeply liberating. It allows 
us to have much more productive conversations, and at times to push back. If 
the boundary is set in the wrong place that is fine, we can review it, but having 
boundaries allows us to have a much more fruitful conversation and collectively 
go further together. 
“The truth is that it took me a while to learn this. Not till my mid-thirties. 
I think my twenties was probably spent in thinking that the emptier the space, 
the better it was. I deliberately set out to destroy boundaries. Now I have this 
concept of leading being about creating a vessel, and the vessel to me now helps 
create freedom and liberation.
“I look for boundaries in the leaders who lead me now. Y es, I want a say in 
setting those boundaries, but I want to know where we are going and what our 
constraints are. The boundaries have to be wide enough, and I must be allowed 
to question them. But they must be there.”

Thoughtful and Risky
These two are switchers. Y ou move from one to the other when you know the 
moment is right. As you go, you need to watch out for the strong forces that 
push you away from both of them: from risky, because the price women pay 
for risks and mistakes is very high, and from thoughtful, because the speed of 
change all around us pushes us to think that thoughtfulness is not an option. 
Y et both are crucial – both feed each other, and avoiding either of them does 
not work. Nor, of course, does getting stuck in one or the other. If you do, peo -
ple either get tired of waiting for your thoughtful decisions or fearful of what 
risk you are going to drag them into next.
Thoughtful  
Folawe is clear: “ At times, you have to resist the sense of urgency and the in -
stinct of fight or flight. The prevailing systems and culture will always push you 
to rush, to deliver, to action and to keep going. Make sure you push back.” (Pod -
cast 10) 
I remember being sent away in the early days at Common Purpose, by the 
chair of the board, spitting with anger, to produce a growth plan. He had over 
10,000 staff in his organisation, so a vast fleet of people to delegate to. I had ten 
at the time, and a vast list of actions to be done by the end of the week. I was 
outraged by his blindness. But it didn’t take me long to realise what a fool I was. 
I was ignoring data, missing trends, blissfully ignorant of dependencies and liv -
ing on a diet of risk. Y ears on, I still get embarrassed when people remark on my 
foresight in investing very early on in IT and remote working. It was all because 
of that chair. He forced me to take a step back, to get thoughtful as well as risky.
Latanya says she sees it over and over again: “People just go from challenge 
to challenge, from fight to fight, neither recognising success nor being strate -
gic.” (Podcast 29)
Melissa Berman says thoughtful moments sometimes lead you to call stop, 
“because you see that you will not get the success you sought. Or because this is 
the moment to step out so that a new person can take over leading. Or because 
Elements | 183
the game has changed, and it needs even more of a rethink. Or because the vi-
sion has shifted, and it is no longer you. 
“Or even because your own life has changed, and you cannot give it what it 
needs. This final one is too often recognised at the last moment when you realise 
that nobody can go on forever. Burnout is real. Y ou stay too long and then you 
start to feel shut out. Of course you must lead for the long game, but you have 
to be astute about when to either step back or eventually step out.” (Podcast 30)
Risky
As thoughtful as we may want to be, risks are required, moments need to be 
seized, decisions need making even when we don’t have the complete data or 
full picture. Our Essence tells us to take those risks as our ancestors did, as 
nature does, as mothers do, as our education demands of us, and despite the 
trauma we may feel. And we know that in some situations the riskiest thing we 
could possibly do would be to do nothing and avoid taking a risk at all.
Nichole and Hila say there is no alternative as we look to the future.
Nichole Bradford, a professor at Stamford who anticipates huge shifts 
ahead, is clear: “Leading will require us to keep going when everything around 
us is spinning and changing so fast. However fast you think things have changed, 
they are about to speed up dramatically and the impact will be compounding. 
It will be in five major areas: data, materials, energy, food and transportation. 
And Artificial Intelligence is coming to all five to take the change curves and 
put grease on them. 
“ An example of this is that until about five years ago, when AI was first 
getting applied to material science, all of mankind had come up with maybe six 
to seven new materials each year. This has now gone to 36,000 per year. This is 
happening in all different areas, and they are triggering each other so that the 
speed of change is compounded.” (Podcast 39) 
Hila is of a generation that can see what is coming and knows the risk-tak -
ing and bravery it is going to require. There is an urgency for leaders to act, 
bravely act. Her generation is almost unique in human history because the 
problems it faces have a limited deadline to fix. As she says, “this will definitely 
184 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
define how we lead. I think my generation has witnessed a lot of avoidance and 
faffing about and I am not sure how this will play out when people my age get 
to those positions of power. W e will not have the time to avoid the issues and 
we also know that avoidance does not work. I think that as a generation, we 
are very good at seeing through the smoke and mirrors and getting to the root 
of the problem and realising that what we need right now is action. W e do not 
need talk. W e need brave action.” (Podcast 16)
If this level of risk is demanded of us ahead, we will need to face head-on 
the problem that the price of mistakes for women is very high. If our actions im -
mediately yield results, we are judged effective at leading. If results are not im -
mediately forthcoming, we are judged for being a woman. There is little safety 
net, if there is one at all. And when a woman anticipates the challenges, she is 
often portrayed as emotional or even unprofessional. 
The danger is that we become less inclined to take risks and give the im -
pression that we need protecting. Lailamah Khan, a young student in Pakistan, 
resents this: “There is this stigma here that girls are unsafe, weak and vulnerable. 
W e cannot be left alone. W e cannot take care of ourselves. That may be true for 
some girls, but there are a lot of women out there who are perfectly strong and 
perfectly capable of taking care of themselves. I know some of them. And I like 
to think I am one of them.” (Podcast 21)
The unequal risk barometer makes many of us angry, but when we express 
this, we are usually dismissed on the basis that anger is one of those emotions 
to be avoided when leading. W e are told that it is the first step towards losing 
the argument.
As an aside, I want Hila, Helena, Latanya, Hinemoa and Folawe to explain 
the disdain they feel these comments deserve.
First Hila: “I think that anger is extremely important. It has always been a very 
important tool for successful movements, even the driving force.” (Podcast 16) 
Then Helena: “Of course you get angry and feel let down. My own govern -
ment did nothing to help the women jurists we got out of Afghanistan last year. 
In fact, they got in the way. I used to stop myself from displaying anger. I would 
hold myself back. I still occasionally do. But now I have learned to be much 
Elements | 185
more directional about how I place my anger. At the right time it can prompt a 
useful response. I do know that I express it in a way that people find it hard to 
hear, but I think that they have to hear it.” (Podcast 29) 
Over to Latanya: “ Anger is an emotion that can drive a lot of change, gen -
erate a lot of Energy. I think if you are not angry, then you are probably in the 
wrong game. If it does not make you angry, it probably will not make you do 
anything much. Anger fuels people. It’s curious watching women lead. They 
often become hard as nails with people who get in their way, and then they are 
deeply loving and soft when they care for their colleagues.” (Podcast 29)
And then Hinemoa: “W e need to express our anger about some of the stuff  
that is going on. Frankly we have all been conditioned to a greater or lesser de -
gree to be ‘nice’ about things. T o always look for some kind of middle ground. 
That is a skill, but that is not the only skill.” (Podcast 1) 
So anger is not to be dismissed, but we must not let it drive the risks we 
take. W e are too thoughtful to let that happen. 
And the same can be said for fear. Latanya has read many of the writings 
of modern-day women who have been murdered for their actions or beliefs: “I 
don’t believe that they were fearless. I think that is not the word. Many of them 
knew that they were being followed and they were being openly threatened, but 
that fear did not immobilise them. They kept going. It did not stop them. T o be 
fearless is one thing, but they were with fear.” (Podcast 29) 
Camila Pontual, who works on the protection of the Amazon in Brasil, de -
scribed her friends in the same way: “They decided to combine their inaugura -
tion events as government ministers. T o do it alongside each other, to showcase 
union. It was the day after the terror attack on the Brasilian parliament. They 
were in the same building, the same rooms. The cleaners had cleared them up 
and repaired overnight. 
“Both of them avoided the usual boring speeches. Instead they spoke from 
their hearts. They were orators. People listened to every word. Some were sob -
bing because it was such a beautiful moment. And they ended up with music. It 
was an indigenous traditional ceremony there in the middle of that palace. The 
186 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
beautiful lyrics were based on the fight of many Black women who have been 
silenced for centuries in Brasil.”  
I asked Camila if she thought that her friends were terrified inside, as they 
did what leaders must sometimes do: hide their fears and use symbolism to per -
suade people to lift above their own fears. Camila answered, “courage is not 
ignoring the fear, but it is doing it regardless. Of saying ‘look where we are. W e 
feel imposter syndrome but we are in a good place, a place that generations of 
women have never been allowed into. W e are here together.’” (Podcast 44) 
There are just so many amazing women who risk it all and lead. Their sto -
ries are endlessly inspiring and, if you are like me, they are also daunting. I think 
of Stella’s words: “I am a vulnerable Black woman.” I hope Stella will forgive me 
for editing them so that I can use them too: “I am a vulnerable woman.” 
W e all have our doubts as we take our risks. Even the author of the Rebel 
Girl  books does. Francesca: “When I started Rebel Girls, what kept me going 
was this idea that I could not fail. People were looking up at me as the first 
Italian female founder that was accepted in an incubator in Silicon V alley. On 
one side, this was a positive feeling that gave me the fuel to keep going not just 
for myself but also for other people. But on the other side, it made me convince 
myself that if I failed it would be because I was bad at leading and that I did not 
deserve any of the opportunities that I had got. 
“ As female leaders we want to be perfect. W e want everybody to like us. 
W e want everybody to say that we are great at leading. But in reality, leading is 
establishing priorities, getting people out of their comfort zones, then enabling 
them to do the work that they would not do if you were not there. It is often 
uncomfortable and sometimes we do not know exactly how uncomfortable it 
can get before it becomes really toxic. W e make all sorts of mistakes, have to be 
incredibly vigilant, accept that we know more or less what we know. T ake time 
out to rethink and know more. W e try to have a sense of what we are doing 
and what its impact will be. W e have to take risks and allow ourselves to make 
mistakes all the time.”
Last word to Susan Whitehead, for many years a leader at MIT. She re -
flected on how long it had taken her to get to this point in her career: “I silenced 
Elements | 187
myself and I kept on silencing myself. I wasn’t fearless. I wonder whether many 
of us are the same. Are we silencing ourselves or are other people silencing us? 
What has become very clear to me is that you can’t do anything of meaning in 
this world unless you are conscious of what you are fearful of. Y ou have to ‘go to 
the mouth of the dragon’ with your fears if you want to live a full-bodied life. 
Name your fears, whatever they are – small or large – even if they seem foolish 
or embarrassing, and live with them. Otherwise those things that you’re afraid 
of will rule you, and you will not take the risks you know you should take.”
Risk-taking is required, combined with thoughtfulness. And let’s not pre -
tend; they are often propelled by anger, and they carry fear. 
Y ou now have our eight combines. Some are switchers, some are overlap -
pers. I am sure that all seven must resonate with you to some degree, but you are 
sure to have some of your own to add. In my Elements for combining, I would 
add serious and fun. Mona tells me she would add into hers risk and fear.

Solo
Go back to your map and keep filling in the Elements circle. As you add the com -
bines, maybe think about which of the two you tend to revert to. The size of the 
combine circles can indicate this.
Figure 9: The combines
Now go a step further. Draw a horizontal line across a page in your journal. 
Add one line for each of the combines. At each end, put one of the two Elements 
that need combining. Treat each line as a sliding scale. Now put a green dot where 
you are on the sliding scale now. Find another coloured dot and place it where 
you think you want to be on the sliding scale in six months’ time. And then choose 
another colour and do the same for where you think it might have been in the past.  
T alk to one of the leaders on your list about the combines you find most chal-
lenging. How do they get the combining right?
In a group
It’s about time for the group to do some play. Here are two suggestions:
Elements | 189
Write some group poems:
Every group member completes the following sentence at the top of a page. It starts 
with:
“She used to think leading was about…” 
Once done, each member folds the page over so that what she has written is not 
visible and hands it on to another member of the group.
Each member will now have received a folded piece of paper from another 
member. Now, without reading the sentence above, complete the following next 
sentence at the top of the folded page that you have been given. It starts with:
“Then she started to lead by...”
Once done, each member folds it over so that what she has written is not visible 
either (so there are now two folds) and hands it on to another member of the group.
Each member will now have received a piece of paper from another member 
with two invisible sentences on it. Now each member completes the final sentence:
“ And as a result…”
Last step now. Hand it on again. Each member unfolds the page they have 
been handed and reads it out to the whole group.
Create a mask:
Each member creates a mask. The front of the mask should illustrate the kind of 
leader you want to be. On the reverse, illustrate what is holding you back from 
being the kind of leader you want to be. Y ou can create a beautiful, elegant mask or 
you can use a paper plate and draw on it quickly.
Explain your mask to others in the group and ask them about their mask.
190 |Expression
W e move now to the outer circle and to how Essence and Elements play out 
in how you lead. Much of your Expedition up to now has taken you inwards; 
now look more outwards and get practical. T alk to women you admire, whom 
you have observed chairing meetings, or doing talks, or driving negotiations, or 
surviving upheavals, all doing the hard work involved in leading and doing it 
in a way that reflects their Essence. T alk to them and ask the ‘who, what, when, 
where, how’ questions. The feet on the ground questions. Capture all the tips 
you know will work for you or that you want to try out for yourself. 
I have met countless women on the First Expedition and through the weekly 
podcast episodes. This section captures the highlights from some of those con -
versations. I offer them as illustrations of the discussions you might have and of 
the practical tips you are after so that you can build up your Expression circle. 
Keep to precise questions. It’s those tips you are after. For example, I have 
always struggled when chairing a meeting to find a way to close people down 
when they are banging on. My Essence has in it, amongst other things, mother -
ness. And this shows up in my Elements in many ways; one of them is kindness. 
So how do I express this in meetings when I know we have to move on? How 
do you do it without crushing people but equally without implying that you 
agree with them? I saw someone do this well, and I have stolen their technique. 
They interject, “that is very helpful” just at the right moment when the person is 
Expression | 191
about to draw breath again. It works, and now I use it a lot. I shall be very ner -
vous about using it on the podcast now! This is an example of the granularity 
of tips you are after. This one works for me and it connects back to my Essence. 
Here are eight extracts from interviews rich in tips:
192 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Leading Performance 
Monica Medina has led schools in multiple countries across her career and 
knows a great deal about leading those difficult conversations about perfor -
mance, the ones we all have a tendency to put off. I asked Monica how to make 
them go as well as possible. She made a list of what not to do.
 Babble
“I grew up in a home where English was not the only language. I consider Por -
tuguese to be my first language. I find it is helpful for me, as a second language 
learner, to plan what I am going to say. Sometimes it takes just a couple of min -
utes to capture some key points. Other times I actually have notes in front of 
me. If it is a really tricky meeting, I go to one of the assistant principals and he 
always asks me, ‘are you in the zone?’ If my answer is no, we rehearse carefully. 
The more prepared I am, the more succinct and clear I am. I am also always 
ready to give examples of what the expectation is, how to move forward, how I 
am going to help the person to get to a better place.
“I am a talker, you know. I can talk and talk. So I really have to be sure that 
I go into the meetings ready to focus on what is important. So absolutely no 
babbling.”
Confess 
“No confessing. I mean, honestly. People do not come to my office to hear my 
problems. So no expressions such as ‘this is really hard, but it is even harder for 
me.’ Leave all your own issues at the door.
“Y ou just want to stick to very simple messages. Like, ‘I hear you’ or ‘I am 
sorry that you feel that way, but this is how it needs to be.’ Sometimes, ‘let us 
take a break. Let us talk again tomorrow’ . This gives you and the other person 
the opportunity to start a conversation fresh. I think it is a really healthy ap -
proach. Especially at those times when you have not slept the night before or 
you are dealing with personal issues or other professional issues at the school, 
Expression | 193
and you are not at your best. Just say, ‘I hear you. Y ou hear me. Let us meet again 
tomorrow and see if we can move forward.’”
Fast forward 
“This is pretty heavy stuff you are discussing. Y ou are talking about someone’s 
performance. If you rush, you are saying, ‘this really is not important. Y ou as a 
person are not very important to me.’ I think that is a bad message. Y ou have to 
send a message that you are supporting them in whatever shift they need to make.”
Collapse
“Prepare yourself mentally so that as soon as the meeting gets tough, as soon 
there is an ounce of resistance, you don’t change or, worse, collapse your position. 
“I remember being in an open faculty meeting when a couple of teachers 
told the principal, with me seated there, that they did not like me, they did not 
want me there as the assistant principal and they were not going to do what I 
said, whatever I told them to.
“I knew moving forward that I was perceived as unimportant, ineffective, 
ignorant, was no added value to the school. As a result, initially I found myself 
backing down on just about everything, but I quickly learned that what I then 
said was deemed even more unimportant. I was seen as uncommitted because 
even I did not believe what I was saying. Everything they thought about me was 
just illustrated by my behaviour.
“If, in your meeting, you can feel yourself starting to give in, then take a 
break. Because if you do cave, let me tell you that person will tell everybody 
who will listen the moment they leave the meeting, ‘I told her, she pushed me 
hard, but I told her, she tried to get me to do x, y and z, but I told her.’ And that 
message will travel through your school like wildfire.” 
Wing it
“Y ou have to prepare. T o ask yourself if the issue is skills or will. If it’s skills, then 
the solution is straightforward because it is a matter of filling the skills gap, of 
194 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
providing opportunities to practice in a safe environment, of giving them short 
term wins and giving regular feedback.
“If it is about will, it will need unpacking. There are times, not often, when 
the person raises a good point. Y ou listen to their thinking, and you say, ‘I really 
want to think about what you just said. Can we talk again tomorrow?’ Because 
maybe they are right. 
“ And there are other times when the person says, ‘I have been successful as 
a teacher. My parents really love me. My kids love me. I am popular. Now you 
want me to risk all this to do as you want?’ There are times when you have to 
face the fact that this teacher is not going to change. They are either unwilling or 
unable to shift their practice. And that is the hardest conversation of all. Y ou will 
support, but you need to be firm that this is what you expect, in this timeline. 
And there are no more questions. If it goes this way, you have to be one hundred 
percent certain that this is what you need to do; there is no turning back. 
“Using this process has helped me to not lose a lot of sleep, because by the 
time I have got to the crunch point, I have felt that I had done everything I 
could to support. 
“So no babbling, confessing, fast forwarding or collapsing. And be pre -
pared. But all this does not make it easy. It doesn’t mean that I didn’t feel bad af-
ter each meeting, that I did not have a lot of empathy for the teacher. However, 
my bottom line is: ‘I have two sons. Is that a classroom I would put my own 
child in?’ If the answer is no, then I was really doing a disservice to the school 
and to the students by not being firm and clear. Let’s face it, that is the job when 
you are leading. Y ou are the one who is responsible, in the end, for the perfor -
mance of your school and students.” (Podcast 34) 
Monica’s advice covers pages and pages in my journal, mostly with lists of 
my mistakes alongside it. Sometimes because I did everything I could to avoid 
having these conversations because I did not want to upset people, or because 
I had convinced myself that it was all my fault and that I was being unreason -
able, but most of the time it was me not having the courage of my convictions. 
And sometimes it was because I did the opposite; I jumped in too quickly to a 
Expression | 195
conversation because it had been weighing heavily on me and I wanted to get 
through it. Inevitably, I started ill prepared and ended in a mess. 
I keep that old saying ‘mortgaging the future’ firmly in my mind, knowing 
that if I ignore difficult conversations, things just get worse and worse and then 
boil over. Because problems don’t go away, and if I don’t deal with them I also 
risk losing a great performer in the team because they get fed up with carrying 
the extra weight.

Leading Teams
Kelly McCallum’s experience comes from leading a major sports team, some -
thing I have never done. This made Kelly the person for me to talk to about 
teams. She gave me one thing to recognise, two things to do and two things 
never to do. She began with the 10,000 hours concept, a new one for me.
10,000 hours
“ As women, we were born into relationship building. It is how we are socially 
constructed. There is a saying in sport that 10,000 hours of practice makes a 
person an expert in a skill. As women, I guess we have reached those 10,000 
hours of relationship skills by the time we are eight years old. So we have that 
edge because for whatever reason we have had lots of practice at relationships. 
W e have done our 10,000 hours. 
“If relationships are ingrained in women, they are also ingrained in leading. 
W omen have this by just being women, and it is about time we recognised our 
edge. I don’t think we often put our hand up going into interviews or board -
rooms and say, ‘I have 10,000 hours of skills in relationship practice.’ W e don’t 
give ourselves enough credit for this.”
People, people, people
“There is a saying: ‘it’s about people, it’s about people, and it’s about people.’ 
T eam sports give us relationship practice over and over again. My priority as the 
captain every time is to form connections with every single player on that field in 
some way that shows them that I care. 
“For example, I remember playing the Singapore National T eam. One of 
my team made that game hers; she must have scored about eight tries. She was 
absolutely awesome and she knew it. When later, we went to play for Canada. 
W e had a general call out and I just looked at her and just said, ‘Singapore.’ She 
gave me the nod and a smile. It was a special connection that me and her shared 
and it was really important.”
Expression | 197
Communicating
“T eam sports are an experience of uncertainty over and over again. W e can pre -
pare as much as we want, but we cannot predict the outcome because there 
are just so many complex things that can happen in a game. Either side can be 
winning at any time. 
“So communication in the moment, which is clear and heard by the team, 
is paramount. What I mean by heard is that there is recognition by everyone 
that we are still on the same page and moving forward to our vision. That nod or 
that eye contact is really important to understand that we are all in this together. 
When you communicate well, you bring down the uncertainty. Y ou control 
those negative emotions. It feels good. There is connection and synergy within 
the team. Y ou know that uncertainty will fail to break those connections. 
“I remember a game when we only had four minutes to try to win. A little 
bit of synergy was feeling broken, the negative emotions were coming in, the 
uncertainty was flooding in about winning or losing. I was full on with mini 
bits of communication, getting to every single person on that field very, very 
quickly. A word, an eye contact, a small gesture individual to each player. It’s 
quick, sometimes it’s just a little wave. 
“One of my teammates used to say that when she saw me flick my ponytail 
at her, she knew that I was okay and that we were still connected. People say 
there is no time for this, but there is always time, always a moment. And that is 
what I love about leading. There is always a moment that you can connect. Flick 
your ponytail. 
“ And when you do, remember it is also about keeping your head up. 
Especially when a mistake has happened. Head up, chest up, look forward 
whenever those negative emotions start to come on.” 
No overthinking
“Never, ever overthink. It is the number one of the most important things I 
have learnt in leading sport teams. If you overthink, they will score while you 
are thinking. Of course, before the game you think a lot, but during the game 
you need to think in the moment. Leaders must react quickly to turn a negative 
198 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
into a positive. Doing so will define your leading. Think before and think after 
but not in the middle of the game. 
“Often, it is about reframing very quickly. I remember when we were play -
ing the USA and the referee was penalising us all the time. After the third pen -
alty, I brought the team in. I said, ‘we are going to create a situation where we 
take the referee out, ’ It was my decision.”
I jumped in here with Kelly. So far, the sports examples had made a lot of 
sense, but ‘take the referee out’ was a new one. Kelly explained: “The referee was 
controlling our emotions, so I had to bring the control back to me. W e changed 
our game; we stopped going in to contest the referee’s decisions and that took 
the referee’s controlling factor out of it. Players don’t like doing this, so it was 
hard, but it worked.
“Leading does involve some very hard decisions. W e mustn’t avoid them. 
The decision I took that day was not easy or at all popular, because it was not 
how the team wanted to play. But as much as I believe in collective leadership, 
this decision was mine.”
Humiliating
“Don’t humiliate anyone in your team. If someone has made a mistake, do not 
humiliate them by amplifying it to the whole team. Y ou can crush a person in a 
second if you do, and that is not what you need. It destroys the connections, the 
synergy, right across the whole team and there is no easy coming back from it. 
“If you do ever get in that situation, because we do sometimes, it will just 
be a long process of lots of conversations to build the trust again. Y ou have to 
restart from the beginning. So the best way is to not get into that situation.” 
(Podcast 19)
The sense of Energy and pace talking to Kelly was inspiring and empow -
ering, too. When we had finished speaking, I immediately regretted not asking 
her for advice on how to put a team together. Martyna’s orchestra is so carefully 
chosen. I suspect Kelly’s team is too. What does she look for? How does she 
balance the skills? What characters, temperaments, cultures, attitudes does she 
Expression | 199
look for? How does she cover the blind spots? I will ask Kelly next time and I 
promise a podcast episode with her replies.
In the meantime, I have adopted many of Kelly’s tips, especially the small 
rituals you need to establish with each individual member of your team. It’s a 
powerful concept. I think that I have often done it subconsciously but not de -
liberately and consistently and with every single member of a team. Now I will.

Leading Trust 
Y ou will have probably picked up my obsession with midwives by now. I have 
become fascinated by how lightly they choose to lead in a labour room and how 
hard it is for them to lead outside the labour room. So I turn to Harriet Nayiga 
in Uganda about the first and then Sylvia Hamata in Namibia about the second.
T rust others
Harriet: “It is very tempting to be the health professional in the room, the one 
with all the knowledge, to assume things before they happen, to know bet -
ter than the women who are giving birth, to quickly forget that everybody is 
unique. But you can’t go this way. When you walk into the labour room, you 
have to make sure that every assumption, any knowledge you think you have, 
you drop it. Y ou need to remove yourself from that high position of power that 
you think you have. 
“The real meaning of midwife is ‘to be with a woman.’ W e forget this and 
yet most of the time women do not need us because the body is designed to 
deliver babies. The midwife is just there to jump in if there are complications, 
to make good decisions only because the woman will be vulnerable and cannot 
do things on her own.
“I try to ensure to drop every form of power that I think I have. T o strip 
myself of power and ensure that I am working with the woman. T o listen to her, 
to trust her instincts about her own body, to be empathetic with her. And when 
I do this, and she sees me doing this, I find that the woman responds by trusting 
me back. She tells me things and does not keep things from me. She trusts me 
more because she sees me listening and then acting on her words as a result. She 
knows that even if I am not able to do something, I will explain to her why.
“I can think of many times when the woman has been right and by building 
the trust between us, we have prevented something disastrous happening. She 
would say, ‘I am not comfortable’ and I would reply, ‘what do you mean you are 
not comfortable?’ And then she would tell me the problem, and I would check 
and say, ‘ Are you sure? I have checked and I do not see anything’ and she would 
Expression | 201
ask me to check again, and I would go back and realise that ‘oh no, we need to 
do something about it now.’” (Podcast 28)
T o me, this was a beautiful story of leading. These are learning points that 
go way beyond midwifery. Y ou take on a role, you are given training, you get a 
job title and with it, power, and then if you are Harriet you choose to give it all 
away. Because then the person you are leading will trust you and work with you. 
Then, because most of the time you are not needed and it’s best for you to be out 
of the way, you step back until you are really needed, and then you take action 
decisively and quickly and colleagues will allow you to do so because you have 
built up trust. If the word midwife means ‘to be with a woman, ’ maybe our new 
definition of the word ‘leading’ should be ‘to be with people.’
T rust yourself
Sylvia: “It is suffocating the moment you walk out of the labour room. Y ou have 
no voice. There is so much that you see and so much that needs to be said but 
it continues to go on without your voice. Y ou may want to say something, but 
nobody would listen to you. It is like you open your mouth and nothing comes 
out. There isn’t anybody to listen to you. 
“Soon you start to doubt yourself, to no longer trust yourself. Y ou think 
that the real reason why nobody is listening to you is that what you say doesn’t 
mean anything. Y ou think maybe you are not smart enough, simply not good 
enough. Or maybe you are just wrong. And so you stay away, you pull back into 
that little corner where you feel it’s safer. Y ou think that if you do not say any -
thing, you won’t get criticised. And you become scared of what people would 
say if you did speak out. 
“Y ou remain this person who doubts herself, wondering if you belong. 
Then one day you just boil over. Everything comes out at once. That is the day 
when everybody says you are emotional and irrational because you do not make 
much sense as you try to put everything together. Someone suggests it is ‘just 
that time of the month.’ I think that is the most demeaning statement ever. And 
it is even worse if it is that time of the month. Y ou become a perpetually frus-
202 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
trated person and even when something good is happening, you miss it because 
you only see what is wrong. 
“I have been in there. I left practising midwifery because of it. I moved 
to family planning and immunisation for women and children. But it was the 
same there. Eventually, if nobody wants to listen to you, you start taking action. 
What finished me off was running a clinic every W ednesday in the morning 
and our uptake was very poor. The only source of local employment was picking 
grapes, and no woman was going to lose out on income on a W ednesday morn -
ing. So I started offering immunisations at night. When I was found out, I was 
in trouble. 
“It was then that I thought that I had to get out of midwifery completely 
and when I did, people started talking to me, listening to me and telling me that 
I mattered. I met successful women doing great things and discovered that I 
was not the only one with self-doubt. I stopped being scared of highly achieved 
people. I realised that they know what they know, and I know what I know. And 
I started talking.” (Podcast 28) 
In some cases, during the First Expedition, I learnt tips from the women 
that I met, like Harriet; at other times I made promises to myself. Sylvia 
prompted a promise. I have her words pinned up above my desk. They tell me 
to take time to listen and never ever (I hope) fail to. Because to make someone 
like Sylvia feel small, and that she cannot trust herself, that is not right, never 
mind not clever.

Leading Creativity
Jennifer Stein and Vivi are theatre directors, one in a Canada and the other in 
Argentina. I think about leading creativity and innovation often, and of how 
to get beyond group think, but I don’t think I have ever spoken about this to a 
theatre director. So this was a priority.
Jennifer: “ At the start, you have to believe in yourself and absolutely believe 
that you are going to get to somewhere great. It is an act of faith, and you have to 
believe in the people around you, to know that when you enter the room with 
your accumulated life experience, so does everyone else. Harnessing all this is 
where the magic will come from.
“When I began my career as a young theatre director, I watched extremely 
charismatic – and also extremely forceful – directors come into the room and 
tell everyone how it was going to be. One particular director, throughout the 
rehearsal process, used these little cardboard cut-outs of people on a cardboard 
model of the stage. He would move them around to tell people how each scene 
was going to go. It was probably one of the first rehearsal processes I was in -
volved in, and I was amazed how it worked. But looking black, it didn’t work. 
“Slowly, I found my own way and it did not involve standing still. I moved 
around because I wanted to see what was going on, to see each performer’s face 
and get really physically engaged.”
Distance
“I am deeply curious about personalities, but I also keep a bit of a distance at 
the same time because you need to leave a rehearsal unencumbered by everyone 
else’s emotion. Y ou do not want to take it all in. Y ou learn to do this as a creative 
person, particularly through the audition process. At the end of a day of audi-
tions, you leave exhausted and completely drained if you absorb everybody’s 
desires and anxiety. Y ou can be sensitive to what people are feeling, you can 
respect feelings carefully but not take them in. If you do, you lose your vision 
and objectivity.”
204 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Momentum
“But you do use your curiosity to understand different people so that you are 
able to amplify the voices that are carrying the creativity along. Y ou must be 
wary of the voices that are bringing the process to a standstill. Sometimes it is 
about timing, and you will have to say to them, ‘wow, you brought up something 
really interesting, let’s schedule some time for you and me to work through it, ’ 
and meet the person separately. It’s about orchestrating the flow for the whole 
group. And it’s also important to remember that some people are quieter than 
others and they often have a lot to say when they do speak. 
“The other thing to watch for is splinter groups or dissatisfaction and what 
direction it’s pointing in. Y es, you have to let a collaborative creation process 
run its course. Y ou must let the process breathe. Y ou must give it oxygen, but 
you must also keep a close eye so that things do not burst into flames. 
“Certain things just have to happen, and you have to work through them, 
and you have to embrace that. I learned early on that you cannot come into the 
process with everything mapped out. The whole point is that it is a process of 
discovery. By adapting, you get to a place where the artists own the piece.”
Egos
“Crucially, for all this to happen, you have to leave your ego out of the process. 
Artists will ask probing questions and offer insights – that’s why they are there. 
If you know, deep in your bones, that a particular choice is critical to the whole 
of a project, then you are going to have to resolve it together and you will need 
to say so. But if it is a small variation to what you had originally envisioned, and 
it is not going to disrupt the larger fabric, then you go with it. Y ou have to take 
a moment to step back and decide. 
Pivot
“Maybe you will feel like you are stepping into the abyss because there is no set 
plan, but go with it. It is live, and it is wonderful. Why do you feel like you’re 
stepping into the abyss? Because you forget you can always change your mind! 
It’s impermanent. 
Expression | 205
“I call it the goalpost theory of creating. W e all have to get the ball within 
these two goal posts, but there are a million different ways to do this. This is why 
you are in the room with them anyway, leading. Y ou go through the planning 
phase and it is really fun envisioning the piece, how the costumes will look, how 
the set will function, etc. But then you might go into rehearsal, and someone 
does something amazing, something you would never ever have imagined, and 
you know that it is brilliant. This can even start as early as in the casting process. 
Y ou have envisioned who you think would be an ideal person to play a part and 
then someone walks into the room who is 180 degrees from what you imagined, 
and you go, ‘oh, yes. W ow.’ That is your job when you are leading, to pivot and 
go, ‘oh yes. W ow.’ 
“Leaders, of course, also have to say, ‘oh wow, no’ sometimes too. Saying 
no does not have to be so fraught with fear and concern, almost anticipating a 
negative response. I remember seeing a director say to an actress, ‘you know that 
point when you…’ She replied, ‘yes, ’ and he just then said, ‘don’t do that.’ It was 
said easily and lightly, and everyone laughed and then went on to discuss what 
they would all do instead. Y ou can lower the stakes. It’s not a personal criticism. 
It’s a course correction. It’s serving the larger project. 
“Stay light in your touch. The best three words you can ever utter in the 
creative process are: ‘let’s try it.’ Nothing is lost, let’s just try it. Y ou are validat -
ing other people’s participation. Y ou are working together. Y ou might already 
know how you feel about it. It doesn’t matter. ‘Let’s try it.’”
Resolute
“Go back to that first director I learned from. He had a huge personality. He 
filled the room. T o be clear, I want to fill the room too, but in a different way. 
There is quiet leading, and there is slow and steady leading, and both are some -
times called for. Often there is no need for a big splash at the beginning, partic-
ularly if you are working with new people when it is best to begin quietly, to let 
your presence and your leading grow. Sometimes you simply have to let people 
learn who you are, through your actions and decisions. Y ou build trust that way. 
206 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
And for me, it’s critical that there is joy in the process. If there is a lightness in 
the room, everyone feels it’s safe to participate. 
“Sometimes we all struggle with wanting to be liked. Y ou want to feel their 
affection. But this cannot be the arbiter of your decisions. For a while I was 
making decisions based on wanting people to like me. I learnt that lesson pretty 
quickly: it does not work. Y ou start letting people run roughshod all over you 
and soon you have a train wreck on your hands. Sometimes you have to be very 
decisive and resolute, and it does not matter whether they like you. I had to 
learn this as a young woman, and I had to relearn it as a director. 
“The director’s nightmare I used to have was that I would be facing a room 
full of artists asking questions and I’d say, ‘I don’t know’ and they would say, 
‘but you have to know!’ It was paralysing. I don’t have that nightmare any more 
because I have realised that there is nothing wrong with saying, ‘I do not know.’ 
In fact, now I say, ‘I do not know and that is why we are here.’” (Podcast 31) 
Surprise
Over to Vivi. She goes even further than Jennifer; she deliberately sets out to 
lose control.
“ At the very least put the control in other hands so that you do not have 
it but share it and then watch carefully where it goes. I see things that are not 
right, or that I do not like, but I just let it be. I say to myself, ‘let’s see what 
happens.’ I am not going to rush into correction and say what is right or wrong, 
because I really want to surprise myself. Sometimes the other person brings 
something really surprising. 
“If you control everything, you won’t get surprises. And by controlling, 
you may miss the new ideas that the apparent ‘wrong way’ sometimes leads you 
to. And after all, the right way is so boring most of the time. I think there is 
nothing new coming up if you take that path of being right or certain. The other 
side is more unknown. I like the unknown; it is more dangerous.  
“It is very peaceful when you get leading right, when all the parts come to 
place, and you build a whole. It lasts for a little while, then everything moves on 
again. It is happiness. Simple happiness with a lot of work.” (Podcast 31)
Expression | 207
The sheer volume of tips I got from talking to Jennifer and Vivi was ex -
traordinary. It’s the culture they both work so hard to build that shines through. 
The expressions, ‘let’s try it, ’ ‘don’t do that, ’ (said lightly), ‘I don’t know, ’ and ‘oh 
yes, wow’ stand out. They speak of inquisitiveness and a willingness to go with 
the flow, combined with crystal-clear boundaries established with joy. They 
seem to have perfected the art of combining apparently irreconcilable Elements 
as they lead. They speak of humility and a delight in the ideas, often the better 
ideas, of others. It is no wonder that actors and audiences chose to follow them.

Leading Chaos 
My first boss used to say, “leaders are like tea bags. Y ou don’t know how good 
they are until they are in hot water.” Both Elsa Donoghue in Jakarta, Indone -
sia, and Erin Robinson in Atlanta, USA, were plunged deep and rapidly into 
scalding water. They survived and learned, and I met both and learned a great 
deal too.
Elsa
Elsa was the head of a large school when accusations were made of impropriety. 
I never asked Elsa for details because it was learning about leading that I was 
seeking. But the scale of the horror was very clear when I spoke to Elsa and she 
told me that some of her colleagues ended up doing seven years in prison, un -
justly so, before the issue was sorted. It was a big injustice that happened. 
Elsa started by recalling the moment it started: “I do not know if the word 
is ‘exploded’ but in a very rapid amount of time, events progressed to a point 
at which things were getting out of control. There may have been little mini 
explosions along the way. But in the end, it was rapid.”
Imploding
“I think back about how complex it was and how, at the beginning, we were so 
naïve. W e were certain that we had our procedures in place and that the allega -
tions being made, which were proven in the end to be false, would sort them -
selves out. They did eventually, but with incredibly horrific outcomes for some 
of my colleagues. 
“’Exploding’ may be the wrong word for the school, but ‘imploding’ would 
be the right word for me leading. I went through all of the emotions that you 
can imagine, from concern to guilt and then anger and on to outright fear. And 
it was not just for me but all the people I was leading.
“ As the head, I experienced a tremendous amount of self-doubt. I ques-
tioned a lot of things internally and I held back quite a bit about some of the 
emotions I was feeling. T o start with, I felt conflicted because obviously we did 
Expression | 209
not want anything to happen to any of our students and when allegations like 
that are made your first inclination is to listen to the child. Then as time went 
by, I started to realise that there was no way this happened. It is then that my 
attention shifted to the adults with whom I worked, who were being rapidly 
embroiled in this fantasy-like situation.”
Tr ust
“Somehow, we began to make our way through the maze in a way that not only 
sustained us, but actually ensured that our students were still learning and our 
teachers were still teaching. W e did it as a leadership team through teamwork. 
And I learnt a lot.
“I learned not to delegate the in-person communication to faculty or par -
ents. I learned that when it comes to crisis situations, the communication is 
something that cannot be delegated and that I had to maintain a pretty stable 
outlook. A lot of it was simply by being there, by my stance, my humility, my 
ability to listen, not to rebut, not to contradict and not to dismiss feelings or 
concerns. A lot of this was done nonverbally. 
“I had been at the school for over three years when this happened, and we 
had an incredibly high level of trust with the community. That helped greatly. 
A message that I have always carried with me is that building relationships and 
trust is paramount. I had worked on it diligently. When the crisis hit, parents 
were angry and wondering what was going on, but overwhelmingly, from the 
very beginning, we had a gigantic team of supporters. They knew me as a pro -
fessional and quickly realised that there was no way this could have happened.”
Open and closed
“I did not always get leading right. On one occasion, I overshared with a couple 
who then spun the details I gave them to their advantage. Before you knew it, 
there were more families making allegations. I regretted it immediately, though 
I did it because I wanted to be human and I thought I could trust them. 
“Then sometimes I got it all wrong for the opposite reason. I was too much 
of a stone wall. I felt at the start that I had to be strong. I thought that as the 
210 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
head I could not fold or show that I was scared and, as things spun out of con -
trol, I got more stoic. 
“There was a seminal moment when the deputy head told me that they 
were probably going to prison and that I probably would too. I remember bawl -
ing, just having one of those moments when the cry just came from the gut. I 
had been holding it in for so long. This happened while we were doing orien -
tation at the start of the new year. I remember saying that there was no way I 
could do it. They looked at me and said, ‘yes, you can. Y ou have it in you, you are 
not alone. Y es, you can. ‘ I cannot say that I believed them, but it was a seminal 
moment. W e opened up school and, as hard as it was, we did it. Soon after, a 
member of the leadership team said to me, ‘stop pretending you are okay.’ And 
I said to myself, ‘I am not okay and people are noticing.’ I realised that leading 
can’t be done alone. Y ou cannot either hold the power on your own, and nor can 
you hold the pain on your own. 
“There is something else I learnt about consistency and why it is so import -
ant for leading. It engenders a sense of safety, security and trust. I was consis-
tently visible, out and about. I was not hiding. I was walking about, being pres-
ent, being available, ensuring that no matter what, there was something people 
could count on. 
“W e created routines, almost rituals. W e all – teachers, students, parents, 
community members – congregated every Friday for seven years, at this iconic 
part of the campus called the Dragon Fountain. The dragon is the mascot of 
the school, and that location is beautiful. It was a place of peace for us. If you 
could not make it every week, it was understood that you were there in spirit.” 
(Podcast 32)
I learnt a great deal from Elsa about visibility, consistency, what not to 
delegate, oversharing, rituals and holding your nerve. It is worth listening to 
podcast episode thirty-two, because her voice feels important to hear. 
Of the many points Elsa made, this is the one that stood out a mile for 
me: “Leading can’t be done alone.” It brings back frightening moments in my 
career when I thought that leading was about sharing only the good stuff, and 
that the bad stuff was all for me to shoulder. I carried a lot of the weight and 
Expression | 211
did so gladly and proudly on a number of occasions but, looking back, it was 
not sensible for me. And nor did it work for the team, who had an exhausted 
and myopic person leading them for months, and opportunities were probably 
missed as a result.
Erin
Erin led through a different kind of trauma in her school when a student com -
mitted suicide. As we talked, we drew up a list of her learnings. 
Individual
“Y ou have to take care of all the technical issues, processes, legalities and sys-
tems, but don’t let them distract you from the inordinate amount of time you 
need to spend with each individual. Remembering that not everybody needs 
the same thing at the same time. Y ou simply cannot broadcast generic messages 
to cover everybody, because people are going through things in different ways 
and are on different timelines.” 
Organic
“Y ou have to avoid getting too formulaic. Of course you need a disaster plan, 
but use it; do not fall back on it. Be more organic, pay attention, see where you 
are needed, keep a particular eye on the people who need it, know the networks 
and understand them, know the informal places to pay attention to as well as 
the formal places. There is something about a crisis; people default back to more 
hierarchical structures, but don’t forget what you know about the community 
you lead. 
“There is the usual danger of being dismissed as relying too much on in -
stincts and focusing on the emotional, but I would often reply, ‘I know that 
it’s not logical, but that doesn’t mean that it is not right.’ Y ou need to hold the 
linear and the messy alongside each other. Don’t get all messy, because there are 
linear things that you have to attend to, and don’t get all linear because then you 
will miss the mood.” 
212 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Compassion
“Leading requires compassion. Not empathy but compassion. T o me, compas-
sion is sitting alongside somebody rather than stepping fully into whatever it is 
that they are going through. If you step in, you are going to lose yourself.” 
This ties in with so much that Harriet Nayiga and Ayesha have said. W ords 
mean such different things to different people – empathy, sympathy and com -
passion, used in different contexts but always with a combination of warmth 
and distance. Y et another apparently contradictory combination.
Looking ahead
“Y ou have to figure out when the community needs to start moving on, be -
cause you must always be thinking about what comes next. But be mindful that 
when something really terrible happens, people need to come back together 
over time. In a school, things are cyclical, so this is even more pronounced. Peo -
ple will remember the traumatic event the next year, and there will be markers. 
It does not go away. It resides somewhere and becomes part of the DNA of the 
place. Y ou have to pay attention to that. There is no ‘we took care of this, and 
then it is done.’ It is always there.” 
Calibrating
“People use the word ‘authentic’ all the time. When leading chaos, I think it is 
about being authentic – but only just authentic enough, because in crisis you can -
not go too far into the true message, because that message is not for everybody. 
“People don’t want to feel like you are hiding things, but they also recog -
nise that you cannot tell them everything. For me, it is about watching people, 
listening – really listening – so that you can figure out what you can give people 
that they need to hear without divulging too much. If you give too little, you 
trigger anger and frustration and you lose trust. If you give too much, then peo -
ple feel overloaded and they cry out ‘too much.’” 
Expression | 213
Help
“I think it helps if you do not lead with ego and realise that you cannot be ev -
erywhere and be everything to everyone. What I have to figure out is who are 
the people that I am going to build up and rely on for support, and I have to be 
quite clear with them that I need them. Never underestimate people’s willing -
ness to step up.” (Podcast 32) 
Erin’s list is in my journal. T o me, her advice on authenticity brought back 
the words of my first boss, who used to say, “give people enough so that they can 
say ‘I note.’ Do not try to give people so much insight that they will agree with 
you because that is probably not going to happen. In most situations, ‘I note’ is 
enough and all you will probably get.”
I also love how Erin has very firmly reframed instincts and emotions as 
Elements she values highly.
214 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Leading Together
I was spending too much time with people who lead organisations, and wanted 
more with women who are leading families and communities. And leading 
friends too; this felt especially important given that so many younger women are 
recognising just how crucial friendships are.
I spoke to three young women in different parts of the world. It was a joy. 
T emi, Meena and Marga in Nigeria, India and Argentina would put female 
friendships as central, stand-alone pieces of their Essences. Each one has deter -
minedly cultivated their women friends and they see this as one of the central 
distinguishing features between theirs and their mothers’ generation. They say 
female friendships take time, attention and some basic rules. And that they are 
crucial for women who lead.
Female friendships
T emilade Salami is an environmental activist in Nigeria: “I have amazing friends 
who have helped me up and cheered me on at different times. I can be vulnera -
ble with them and share my life with them, the wins and the losses. This is some -
thing lots of people do not talk about; we absolutely need to shine a light on the 
positive side of our amazing female friendships. It needs shining because we are 
still taught that fellow women are our enemy in Nigeria. W e are not expected to 
have or need any female friends once we marry.”
Meena says that it is the same in India: “ A girl is someone else’s from the 
minute she is born, so she no longer has a sense of individual existence, which 
means there is really no need for her to actually have any friendships. And yet 
they are so essential to women who lead. W e need a lot of care, love, kindness, 
forgiveness and a space to really unwind from what is a high stress activity, which 
comes with high stakes for women. Who else do we turn to?
“It is not just about creating a network to get forwards; it is about recharg -
ing. Leading seems to be a bit like being a sponge; you listen to people and give 
them the time and space to figure things out, to express themselves and to make 
Expression | 215
mistakes and learn. It is exhausting and it also means you are probably going to 
bear the brunt of mistakes that happen. 
“Then there are the microaggressions in the workplace. They are something 
that most men don’t understand. They cause you to question your self-worth 
and judgment; they start eating you up from the inside. I think the only times 
that I have been able to feel better about all this is when I speak to my women 
friends, because they make me realise that what I am feeling is real. 
“T o me, it’s sad that women in India almost never have female friendships. 
If they do, it’s under extreme pressure, involving lots of lying and saying that I 
am going here when I am actually going there. There is a really beautiful word in 
Hindi called ‘saheli’ or ‘saheliyaan’ – translated, it sort of means a woman who 
walks with you. There is just something magical about the word that makes me 
very happy.” (Podcast 48)
Glue
Marga Grobocopatel Marra is a doctor from Argentina; one doctor in a tight 
group of doctors: “W e met in our first year in an anatomy class. W e are all thir -
teen of us now doctors, so it has been seven years. W e all shared the same table 
in class, so we met studying dead bodies. W e are very intimate for every exam, 
we graduated on the same day. W e were also footballers together; we won the 
championship twice.
“I have made a list for you about the secrets of our friendship:
 • It is not a competition
 • Most trouble comes from misunderstandings
 • Each person shines
 • Be there, but no dependency
 • Do not judge
 • Just love and trust
 • Eat strawberries with chocolate 
 • Put in the hard work, starting with understanding yourself  
“The most important is the first. I feel like for previous generations, female 
relationships were like a competition, and this has changed a lot. W e feel no 
216 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
need to compete. Every time one of us gets the better grade, it is no surprise 
because it is always Kata. When she gets the best grade, we all feel like we did 
it together. When we won the football championship, all of us celebrated to -
gether. Our self-esteem is not about competing with friends. Part of this is that 
we are so different. W e each have something in which we are strong and good 
and for each of us it is a very different thing. W e shine with our own thing so 
there is no place for competition. 
“W e talk about things in a very honest way. One time we got into a fight 
because the group split to study for a pathology exam, and we had a very bad 
communication. A part of the group felt like the other part of the group left  
them apart. When we talked about it, it got clear very quickly. W e joke a lot 
about our boyfriends, we say ‘he has to conquer us all.’
“W e always say, ‘Live and Let Live.’ Y ou have a friend who is there for you 
and who you can share your time, feelings and thoughts with, but you also 
know that the person will not absorb all your Energy and become dependent 
on you. It’s a balance. 
“It is really important to not judge your friends. I know we all do that all 
the time. I always say, ‘I will judge you, but I will not tell you.’ My friends tell me 
the truth only when I ask them to.
“In some groups of friends, they have lists of things you have to do to be 
part of the group, like you have to be a feminist and you have to vote a certain 
way, and you have to dress this way. I think this happens a lot nowadays and it 
is not good. W e love each other and we trust each other, and we like to be with 
each other. It is not about the way we dress or our political opinions and not 
where we go to dance or how we use our Instagram accounts.
“W e do have rituals. Every night before a big exam, we always have the 
same dessert that we really love. It is strawberries with chocolate. It makes us 
feel like everything would be fine. 
“ All of us feel like this friendship we have is the proudest thing we have 
done in our life. So when we graduated, we talked a lot that day and all of us 
agreed that we were very proud to be doctors but we were prouder to have built 
Expression | 217
this group of friends that is so strong and so healthy. It takes a lot of work; I 
know it sounds easy, but it is not.
 “I have come to realise that, at the heart of things, it is often about know -
ing yourself. If you do not know yourself so much, you start thinking that your 
friends did something that bothers you when, in reality, it is not something 
your friends did, it is something that is going on inside you.” (Podcast 48) 
I suspect that T emi, Meena and Marga are right. Female friendships will 
be a dominant piece of the Essence of many women of their generation, and 
Marga’s list of how they translate from Essence through to Expression is both 
delicious and intensely practical.

Leading Against the Odds 
I became fascinated by midwives, and then there came another fascination: Bo -
tswana, a country where women lead in significant numbers and yet still have 
to do ‘the dance.’ I spoke to two very senior women, Joyce W ema Isa-Molwane, 
a businesswoman and lawyer, and to Pelonomi again about how they dance in 
very different ways. I sought them out because their experience of dancing is so 
very different from mine and from each other’s.
Boiling frogs
Joyce W ema: “When I speak in boardrooms, the mere fact that I am a woman 
means I must be tactful as to how I get my message across. My male counterpart 
could say something today and it is okay, but if I say it tomorrow the reaction 
could be totally different. Y ou need to read the room, not just in terms of words, 
but in terms of body language, and ask yourself, ‘Should I raise this here and now?’ 
“If I realise that there are sticky things that need to be discussed, I am bet -
ter off speaking to my chief executive on the side. I convince him and he will 
then present the ideas as though they are his own. I do not look for the glory 
that I made the decision or that I advised him, I just want to reach my objective. 
I have decided it is good to lead from behind. 
“Y ou need to understand the battle that you are in before you can prepare 
for the war that is going to come. Sometimes the best way to succeed is to take 
the T rojan horse approach. Fight from within the system, get close to those who 
are the real decision makers and influence their thinking without them realising 
it. In this way, you are able to put things in place for those who are coming be -
hind you. As a woman, if you understand the paradigm in which you operate and 
how best you can make the system work for you, you can make effective change.
“It is an elegant dance. Y ou need to be aware of issues, of the people around 
the table, of the nuances, and you need to be ahead of the pack. Never get tired 
of reading and understanding and researching. A woman undertaking the el -
egant dance, for you to be the best performer on that dance floor, you better 
have your facts straight, you better know what you are talking about. There is 
Expression | 219
no point in opening your mouth and not having something solid to say. Y ou 
need to be confident, you need to be assertive, you need to be knowledgeable, 
robust in your Expression and hold your ground. Be firm but be polite, be re -
spectful. Do not forget about your culture. So the dance is all those Elements 
put together.”
Joyce W ema’s dance is designed to ensure that men never recognise that 
they are no longer in charge. She feeds them her best ideas, knowing that they 
will claim them as theirs. I asked Joyce W ema if that was enough for her, just to 
know that she had a part to play in them.
“Y es. Y ou do the dance because recognition speaks for itself. I do not be -
lieve in doing something and then saying, ‘I did this.’ What you have a hand in 
will show and it will come out. And especially remember: if an idea is not yours, 
you cannot implement it. So who will the implementation be given to? Y ou, the 
originator of the idea. When you implement it is when your glory is going to 
come, but your idea would have gotten the approval at the table, because you 
did the dance to get it to the table.
“I think all of us need to start doing the same dance and open a dance 
troupe so that those who come after us do not have to continue dancing. W e 
have to teach each other the steps. The problem is that if you do the dance for 
too long and by yourself, you will end up perpetuating the dance. 
“The females coming up should not have to do the dance, they should not 
have to fight to be around the table, they should not have to continue being 
gagged. But for me, this is the start of putting all the dances and the efforts to -
gether into one fluid movement that we all understand as women in leadership 
roles, so that we do not have to have this battle going on forever. 
“Keep the example of cooking frogs in mind. First keep it in the tempera -
ture that it is used to. If you are getting it from a pond, you put it at pond 
temperature, you do not start blasting at 100 degrees because it will jump out 
of the pan. So you slowly turn up the temperature. By its nature, it will adjust 
its temperature to its surroundings and before the frog knows it, it is cooked.’ 
“There is a role that we play as we pass through our generations. What we 
do today will impact generations to come. I do not think many women would 
220 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
openly say that they are doing the dance or cooking the frog, because that is giv -
ing away the strategy, but it is okay to plan ahead and be strategic together. This 
is what we do as Botswanan women. W e are stitched to be like this.” (Podcast 25)
Head on
With my mind going round in circles, I spoke next to Pelonomi, who performs 
a very different dance. No boiling of frogs for her. She takes on the fight head 
on. I asked her how she prepares herself for it. 
“Y ou never can prepare yourself absolutely. Y ou will be misunderstood. 
Y ou will be called names. Y ou will be labelled. There will be backlash. People 
will retaliate. I was attacked even by fellow women – in fact, mostly by fellow 
women, the harshest attack came from them. I do not think they are attacking 
me to defend the men. I think some of them are attacking me because they 
would have liked to do what I am doing. Because I moved quicker than they 
wanted to, or because I have done something that they wanted to do but were 
too scared to do. 
“ Anyway, my preparation was to decide early on that as an individual I have 
a mandate to perform. I am very clear about what I am supposed to do, and I be -
lieve in my capabilities on the mandate assigned to me. I decide that I am going 
to do it for as long as I know that I am doing the right thing. And I decide that I 
am not going to be deterred by criticism based on things that have got nothing 
to do with the work that I do. 
“I do not think that there are people who have been investigated at work as 
many times as I have been, but those investigations just fell apart. Some of them 
just died before they started, because they were all based on things that did not 
match up to the truth. I have never gone outside of the rules of what I do. That 
is how I survived. T ruth: truth and pure brawn. 
“I think what we need to learn as women is that leading can bring you the 
power you need if you do it properly, and that power grows with what you do, 
because people see what you do consistently and constantly. 
“If you allow your history, your decisions, the things that you do to be 
overshadowed by some male person, you will never be visible and therefore your 
Expression | 221
power will always be under the shadow of somebody. So go out there, do your 
thing, even your mistakes. Let them come out there, allow yourself to fall and 
get up again. Once people see you dust yourself down, clean yourself up and 
come out again, that is when they will let you build your power. That is how 
they will know who you are and respect you. And the others will get scared be -
cause they see you. They know how powerful you are becoming.” (Podcast 25)
Joyce W ema and Pelonomi are good friends (the kinds of friends T emi, 
Meena and Marga are determined to be and for just as long). Both have com -
mon pieces in their Essences, and yet the pieces play out in very different ways 
in their Elements and Expression. It is a beautiful illustration of just how per -
sonal leading is. One has a trojan horse, the other goes straight in. Both have 
been hugely successful. 
I wonder sometimes, looking back, if I might have had more of an impact 
if I had been better at flattering people. I am very much like Pelonomi. It’s a fair 
question to ask myself, but I fear an irrelevant one because I would never have 
been able to do it. T oo much in my Essence would have got in the way. 
222 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Leading Pace 
T alking to Uma helped me with this. Let me explain.
Pace and speed deeply emanate from my Essence. The piece of my Essence 
that is education (huge classes and not much learning) made me impatient. The 
piece of my Essence that is trauma (I have little recollection of my life between 
the ages of 10 and 15; it was miserable) made me unrelenting. The piece that 
is motherness (there was never any question in my mind that I would have five 
children) made me driven.
So with education, trauma and motherness in my Essence, pace and speed 
was always going to feature in my Elements. But I also knew that how I Expressed 
it when leading would have to be done with care, and that a lot of leading is 
about exactly this: judging pace right. Looking back, getting pace wrong has 
consistently been my weakness. Don’t misunderstand me; I know that getting it 
right has also been my strength because it draws people in. But when I have got 
things wrong, it has often been about charging into things.
So I wanted to speak to Uma, who has led and is leading glorious move -
ments which require an intricate understanding of pace. I thought she might 
help me get better at it.
Sprint or marathon
“Leading is like running a sprint or a marathon. It is all about how well your 
body can distribute its Energy throughout. Y ou must preserve enough Energy 
for your entire run. Y ou have to judge when to slow the pace and when to speed 
it up. Whatever happens, there always has to be a flow of Energy. If not, negativ -
ity seeps in and a split, a break, a tear emerges. And you can feel it. When some -
thing has ruptured, you must attend to the rupture because otherwise the stakes 
are very high. The movement can be destroyed if you judge the pace wrong.
“Y our job is to create an enabling environment in any movement and when 
you do, then you can sprint. Because you can feel the courage, a shared courage 
to challenge the status quo. It is palpable. And it comes with an openness to 
learning, an ability and an agility to act. There is a lightness of play, of imagina -
Expression | 223
tion, curiosity and fun. When this happens, there is no question about slowing 
down. It is magic. Sprinting becomes just so easy. Y ou start breathing in sync, 
you start singing in synergy, you start playing and everything falls in line. 
Fogged out
“Fear sometimes emerges about maintaining, sustaining and surviving. This 
feeling has sometimes frozen me, and that is when I get vulnerable. I feel fogged 
out. It is then I ask myself: what is the most important thing here? What do I 
want to happen? What is the price of doing something like this or not going for 
it? My instinct is to withdraw, but that is when I say to myself, ‘this is not the 
time to withdraw or disengage, ’ and I now listen to others. I know that I can -
not risk seeing the situation only through my eyes, and I stop thinking about 
winning or losing and start to listen to others. They draw me out and release me 
from my freeze. 
“Of course, movements are usually built on things that we want to disman -
tle so that we can shift the power around. But when things get tough or stuck or 
we feel like we are on our last legs, we need to be laser-focused about what we 
all love and we are trying to create together rather than attempt to dismantle. 
At the heart of it all, there has to be purpose. Without it, there is nothing. If it 
becomes unclear or there is a drift or distraction, then we plateau and people 
start to question everything. That is a red flag, and it is time to regroup. 
“This arousal from evocation, rather than arousal from provocation, is 
what keeps me going. There is a surge of Energy in both positive and negative 
ways. When this happens, you suddenly realise that you are not the person in 
control anymore, it has been taken over by a few others. With this comes a real 
sense of joy as the Energy surges and I know I have been shifted to the backseat. 
I cannot even tell you how overjoyed I have felt that it just happened.
“Of course, I have also experienced a sense of being played and manipu -
lated, of being hijacked and sabotaged, when control is taken from me. A drama 
has been created, I have been pushed into the middle of all of it and then been 
dumped. But with experience, I have learned to identify the signs of when it is 
224 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
starting to happen, though I still feel destabilised and exposed, even disempow -
ered and helpless when it happens.
“But when I do get the pace right, that is magic, magic rooted in care, in 
accountability, in non-hierarchical, empowered ways of working. It is a flow of 
Energy and animation. It all lines up. I have felt it, I have experienced it. When 
our desires, our beliefs and convictions and our actions have lined up together. 
I have been in that room. I get goosebumps every time I speak about this. It is 
magical.” (Podcast 62) 
I hope that as you read this chapter about Expression and pick up tips on ev -
erything from tough conversations to rocking boats and from nurturing friend -
ships to boiling frogs, your own list of women to speak to has got longer. And 
with it, the questions you want to ask them. 
Y ou will want to listen greedily to their answers, push them when they 
don’t get practical enough. Make sure that while you do that, you are neither 
dismissing their ideas nor adopting them too quickly or too slowly. Y ou are 
looking out hard for the smallest of tips that make sense and will work for you. 
As your Expression circle grows, keep a watching eye on its connection to 
Essence. 
And watch out that the infinity symbol does not seize up. It should be 
flowing outwards from Essence to Elements to Expression. And flowing back 
too, because as Expression meets the outside world it will discover new things 
all the time. Essence will adjust.
Don’t forget that every one of my conversations in this section is captured 
in more detail and infinitely more beauty in the podcast episodes. If you listen 
to them, you will hear the voices, the emotions, the delights. Enjoy.

Journal
Solo
Get out there exploring big time. Go back to your list of people to speak to. Update 
it. Fill in the gaps now that you are well into your Expedition.
T ake time out to have those conversations. Find out how people lead in prac-
tice in different situations. Get granular. How do they actually lead a meeting? 
What do they do that they know they shouldn’t do? What really works for them? 
How do they connect it with their Essence?
Go to the back of your journal and start a list of tips. Nothing in great detail 
or with too much thought, just tips.
In a group
Find a way to share insights as you go. Y ou might want to create an online MIRO 
board (or whatever app works for you) so that you can capture and share what you 
are discovering for the benefit of each other. And regroup whenever you can, so that 
you can discuss the issues and ideas and even tensions you come across. 
226 |Energy
Right at the start of the First Expedition, when we defined the word ‘leading’ 
and set out to test our hunch that it was not the word itself that was gendered, 
but simply that women go about leading differently. Even then I think we knew 
that we should think of leading as Energy; about managing our own Energy, about 
sparking the Energy inside the people we lead and about generating a microclimate of 
Energy in which things happen around us. 
Lifeblood
Every woman we met – knowingly or unknowingly – led me to believe more 
and more that Energy is the lifeblood of leading. Maybe it’s not what being a 
‘leader’ – the title – is, and it’s not what ‘leadership’ – the state – is, but it is what 
the verb ‘leading’ is all about.
Energy that emanates from Essence. An Essence which guides and grounds 
that Energy. Energy that shows up in our Elements. It causes us to jettison some 
of them because they get in the way. It pushes us to reframe others because, 
reframed, they can turbo-charge Energy. It demands that we land our purpose 
and keep it under constant review because Energy thrives on purpose. It re -
quires us to combine what may appear to be incompatible Elements because the 
sparks will fly when they do combine. Finally, it finds its way to Expression as 
we discover ways to bring Energy into the meetings, problems, opportunities 
and relationships involved in daily leading.
Energy | 227
This is why the infinity symbol lies right across the three circles of Essence, 
Elements and Expression. The three circles gently build on each other, each one 
feeding the next, relentlessly building, and then the infinity symbol just strikes 
across them all. It reflects the flow across them, the constant, dynamic and eter -
nal flow from Essence to Expression. And it’s not a one-way flow, it is two-way. 
Expression flows back into Elements to make sure they adapt to the outside 
world. In this way, the inner world flows to the outer to hold it accountable, 
and the outer flows back to the inner to ensure it evolves. This way, we don’t 
get carried away in our leading by the influences of the outside world, and we 
constantly shine a light on ourselves and don’t retreat inwards, failing to adjust 
in a fast-changing world.
Some people might use the word ‘power, ’ but it’s not the right one here. 
‘Energy’ is a very different word. Ana Luz, Liz and Aparna will explain.
Ana Luz: “T oo often, power just seems to be something to accumulate, 
hoard or wield.” 
Liz: “Even if we stick to the expression ‘power with’ rather than ‘power 
over, ’ it’s still something you associate with abuse of power, something to steal 
from another person, to force people to do something that they may or may not 
want to do, or simply to have more of.” (Podcast 59)
Aparna: “Power feels like a force that sits and accumulates in one place. 
Energy is something that flows.” (Podcast 26)
Liz: “It’s just much more interesting to create Energy which people feel 
and want to be part of because it is so infectious.” (Podcast 59)
There is another reason why there is an infinity sign stretching across the 
three concentric circles. It symbolises the Energy that flows upwards from this 
dynamic exchange. An Energy that generates ever more Energy and enthusiasm 
that becomes contagious as it spirals upwards.
Liz: “Energy attracts like Energy. Energy is mutually reinforcing and in -
creases exponentially once you create the space for it to reverberate so that it 
starts to spiral upwards. If we want to get to a place where our leading generates 
Energy, we have to be aware of the Energy that we are bringing to a situation. It 
is an exhausting responsibility, but I think it is what leading is all about. 
228 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
“Of course, the same is true in the other direction, and Energy can spiral 
downwards. If we show up in a very low Energy state, feeling lethargic or like a 
victim and not operating at a particularly high frequency, then the likelihood is 
that others will pick up on that and they will mirror it. They may show up only 
to do the bare minimum. Low Energy leads to lower Energy and reinforces into 
ever lower Energy. People feel drained, and it turns to apathy and then maybe 
even anger and a narrowing down to winning or losing or being right.”
As it spirals, it remains rooted or anchored firmly back in Essence. Because 
Energy must be handled with great care whichever way it spirals, but espe -
cially as it spirals upwards, faster and faster. Because with Energy comes huge 
responsibility. 
Rouba: “W e are working in a warzone. Some of the decisions I make 
will impact people’s lives, people’s futures, people’s families; just sometimes, 
we change the course of history. I am not saying one decision from me would 
change how things happen in Syria, but it is the addition of all of these small 
decisions by people like me who will definitely impact our future. 
“I think when you realise this, it becomes very frightening, because it increases 
the responsibility. Y ou realise that people are looking to you for answers when some -
times you do not have them. I think these are the moments when you feel scared 
about leading.” (Podcast 10)
I asked Martyna about being in a different kind of limelight, when as the 
conductor you walk out on the stage: “It is not easy to lead right up from the 
front, but I tell myself that I have undertaken the task of leading so I have a 
responsibility and, ethically, I must do it. I enter the room; everyone notices 
me, and everything goes silent. It is very intimidating and has been like that for 
as long as I can remember. I repeat to myself, ‘there is a duty behind leading, I 
should learn how to use the power well.’ Many leaders have this challenge. Y ou 
accept the responsibility of being the leader, and that makes you incredibly visi-
ble and vulnerable to your mistakes. The only way to deal with it is to remember 
that people actually came here because they wanted to listen to something beau -
tiful. That people have come to work with you because they chose to. This adds 
pressure, of course, but somehow it helps too.” (Podcast 45)
Energy | 229
This is why the Energy has to be rooted back to, and anchored in, Essence. 
T o both cope with the responsibility and to avoid spiralling in the wrong direc-
tion. Because Energy generates power (perhaps not in physics, but in leading 
it does, at least it does to me) and maybe you need the right Essence to both 
generate and also to deal with that power. 
Spiralling off
Sarah and I made a list of some of the routes the infinity symbol can take if it 
spirals off in the wrong direction. Sometimes it does without you even noticing. 
Then it becomes a gargantuan task to put things right. 
Figure 10: Spiralling off
W e thought of four such routes. They are all connected to the power that 
your Energy brings you. Y ou deny that you now have power, you come to think 
that you deserve it, you start to assume it or you become consumed with main -
taining it.
Deny 
“If you don’t acknowledge that you have any power, or even deny that you have 
it, you can’t calibrate how you use it, so it will go unchecked.”
230 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
Sarah experienced this first hand and early on: “I moved into a new posi-
tion where I had a lot more of both positional and network power. A great deal 
more clout. I was still the same person who met people for lunch to talk about 
family, so I really did not explore for myself what it meant to have this power. 
I realised quickly that people around me showed up differently because, all of 
a sudden, I had this positional power over them. If I was the first one to speak 
with an idea that I genuinely thought was merely interesting, I changed the tra -
jectory of meetings with my team. People would try to go with my idea even if 
it was terrible. I had to understand positional power, the Energy that I created 
in the room and how best to show up in it.”
I asked Sarah if power had really crept up on her or had it – as it is for many 
– been more about a modesty that caused her to deny her newfound power. “It 
can be both, but remember too that often it is a false modesty. Y ou say, ‘this is 
all because of everyone else’s work and the work that everyone has done.’ I think 
that to be authentic, you have to take credit for the things that you have ac-
complished. W e have been conditioned and coded as women to make ourselves 
small even when it is at the detriment of actually moving something forward.”
Deserve 
“If you believe that you deserve power, that you earned it, you stop being curi-
ous. Y ou surround yourself with people who want to be close to power, people 
who will never tell you under any circumstances that your idea was no good. 
Then you start believing your own spin. Y ou tell yourself that you ‘pulled your -
self up with your own bootstraps.’ Y ou become blind to your unearned privi-
lege, and you find that you are no longer creating Energy. 
“I suspect that this is the dominant model. After all, power does corrupt. 
Y ou become incredibly vulnerable to flattery. People who lead are all to some 
extent vulnerable in this way, but you are particularly vulnerable because you 
seek it out. Because everything needs to validate your deservedness. It is a very 
dangerous place to be.
Energy | 231
“What you don’t see is that it’s really a trap, a plateau, a dead end, and it 
stunts your growth. How could it be otherwise given that you think you have 
come to the culmination of your game?” (Podcast 61)
While Sarah is talking, I am thinking that my birthday is next month, and I 
will be 65. It is sad that too many of us at 65 are in this category, but then again, 
I have seen 25-year-olds in this category. Even 18-year-olds.
Maintain 
If you get to the stage when your sole focus becomes maintenance, all your En -
ergy becomes consumed in maintaining your position and power and every -
thing becomes solely about ‘me, ’ ‘my’ and ‘mine.’ Y ou have forgotten any com -
pass that you might have set and even why you set it in the first place. Y ou have 
almost started hoarding your Energy so as to build your own fiefdom because 
your scarcity mentality has convinced you that there is not enough Energy to 
go around.
Sarah has seen founders who suffer from this, and the organisations that 
they founded suffer as a result because, “the organisation becomes about the 
person and not the purpose. The structures, incentives and culture get built 
around a person, their Energy and their apparent ‘magic.’ It is like Gollum from 
Lord of the Rings in the cave with that precious ring. Y ou have to keep feeding it 
because it’s insatiable. The founder will have tasted power, and now loves their 
own Energy and the position and successes that emanate from it. 
“In some ways, maintenance becomes about survival. Y ou know what you 
are up against and how much of a fight it will be. Y ou know that the system will 
begin to gaslight you soon, it will tell you that you are wrong when you are right, 
and it will pit you against even your greatest of friends. All this means that you 
feel the need to hold on ever tighter to the power that you have. After all, ‘there 
are limited places at the table.’ Y ou will not have jettisoned this Element. So you 
maintain, build up and hoard because you need power at your fingertips.” 
So there you have Sarah’s four dead ends – but as she says: “These don’t 
have to be permanent states. They are only a mental state, so you can catch your -
232 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
self and adjust your route. The key to this is remaining curious, knowing that 
leading is a practice and that you can always grow.” (Podcast 61)
This is why the infinity symbol is so important: it flows in both directions. 
When you connect with your Essence you can realise that you have to rethink 
the Energy you create. And when you engage with the world around you and 
see how people respond to your Energy, you can go back and think again about 
your Essence. Y our Essence evolves continually, as does your Energy, and this 
way you can avoid spiralling off in the wrong direction.
 Sarah’s list surely prompts the question: how do you get Energy back on 
track? How do you reverse the spiral once it has gone off course, or when it 
has started on a downwards spiral and you can feel it draining away towards an 
Energy you don’t like? What then? 
I asked Alia: “I first check my own Energy and to what extent I am con -
tributing to the spiralling. Do I need to eat or go for a walk, spend time with 
friends, do something that is going to spark joy in me? My aim is to ground 
myself and stay steady.
“Then I have to bring the team back to where we should be. Sometimes 
there is somebody who is really rocking the boat in a way that is unhealthy for 
our team’s Energy and I need a direct conversation with them to help shift their 
Energy. It is not an easy thing to do. It is hard, it is uncomfortable. It is not 
something I enjoy, but it is part of our collective Energy, which is sacred. After 
all, our time and Energy are our most precious resource.  
“Sometimes we all need to go away together as a team to change the dy -
namics. At other times, there is a need to bring in somebody new into the team 
because one person moving can change things dramatically. 
“ Above all, my favourite way to shift the Energy is through play. As adults, 
we often leave play behind in childhood. Y et play is a wonderful tool to tap into 
our creativity, shift power dynamics and spark joy and innovation. It appeals to 
a different part of our brains and injects a new Energy. “
I am with Alia on this. I would never go anywhere without my bag of props 
– coloured pens, scissors, glue, post-it notes, mouth organs, stickers of animals 
and smiley faces, play doh, Lego bricks, rolls of paper, packs of cards – so that 
Energy | 233
people can create sculptures, draw pictures, build models, cut out designs, play 
music, sing, laugh, giggle, challenge, redraw, recreate together. One of my fa -
vourites is a file of photos printed out. They are of mountains and waves, of peo -
ple making all kinds of different faces, of famous and hidden places, of familiar 
objects and strange unidentifiable shapes. I have collected them over the years 
and never know quite how they will be used. People just pick them up to illus-
trate a point, or to express a feeling, or to play a game they have newly invented.
Back to Alia: “Y ou don’t always have time to go take a nap or give yourself 
space or design a session of play but, even then, you can pause in the moments 
when you are overwhelmed, take a breath and be thoughtful about how you are 
showing up in the storm. 
“In times when you are surrounded by negative Energy, you have to almost 
create a little bubble around your team. Though you may find that when there is 
opposition all around you, it actually makes the Energy in your own team even 
stronger. It can generate an intense sense of purpose and determination to have 
each other’s backs and not allow differences to drag the team into the negativity. 
Everyone is stronger when holding each other tighter.”
Alia and I spoke about this bubble you have to deliberately create to pro -
tect your positive Energy from the surrounding negativity. For me, it is not 
always negative Energy you have to protect against the most. It is a total absence 
of Energy that I find the hardest. With negative Energy, at least there is Energy 
to work with. There is the possibility that you can turn it around into a positive. 
The killer for me is no Energy at all: there is nothing to turn, and everything is 
an uphill battle. 
Alia: “I want to add just one thing. Energy can feel very different in dif-
ferent cultures. People show up in different ways from you. This can be a gift, 
but sometimes it is difficult to understand or recognise. If you do not take time 
outside of your daily tasks to know people as humans, you are unlikely to under -
stand the Energy around you. 
“In Sri Lanka, for example, tea is an important ritual for many. Y ou often 
have tea before you start a meeting, and discuss people’s families. Y ou are able to 
understand each other and where everyone comes from before you start talking 
234 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
business. Over time, this helps you understand each other’s Energy. And it is 
not just me understanding people, but also them understanding me. This rela -
tionship building is an important part of leading and shaping the narratives you 
build about others, and others build about you.” (Podcast 60) 
Spiralling Up
Moving on from the deathly spiral or the directionless spiral, back to when En -
ergy is spiralling upwards in a beautiful direction. 
Liz: “It’s a mutually reinforcing Energy that enables more to be done, a 
flow state with a real focus on the most important task. The distractions are 
tuned out, creativity is flowing everywhere, momentum is building, things 
are happening and nobody has even noticed how much effort is being put in. 
People have moved out of a low Energy state and stopped thinking about who 
is winning or how, and have got to the place where everyone is winning. It’s then 
that the Energy skyrockets. The expression ‘high Energy’ is often used to de -
scribe when Energy is really flowing well, and yet when you get there it actually 
feels peaceful and calm, full of synergy.” (Podcast 59)
I made a list with Liz of what causes a spiralling upwards to what she de -
scribes unexpectedly as this peaceful and calm state.
Calibrating 
“There is a time and a place for different Energy levels. Really effective leading 
involves identifying in the moment what the situation needs. Y ou may need 
lower Energy and a slower pace when really intense listening is required. This 
will be very different from the kind of Energy you need to generate an action 
phase. Then a different Energy might be needed if say people need to vent and 
express frustrations or anger. It is not always about being in this super high En -
ergy phase that can be exhausting.
“W e make choices about how long we stay in each Energy state. When we 
choose to remain in a certain state, we need to be aware that we are doing so and 
of its impact on the people around us. 
Energy | 235
“This judging of the Energy level is what makes leading so critical. Y ou have 
to use your intuition and learn to trust it. Y ou have to be in a good place yourself 
to do this, not so exhausted or upset that you can’t see clearly. This is so much 
easier said than done. It relates to so many different human dynamics, but it 
speaks to leading requiring the ability to pick up on different Energy levels and 
judge them right. Y ou have to make calls all the time, like whether it is worth 
spending time forcing through an issue or whether to regroup and reconsider, 
knowing that either way there has to be closure and some kind of shift in the 
Energy.” (Podcast 59)
Judgement
“W e are often drawn towards external factors like logistics, systems and pro -
cesses because it is less uncomfortable looking at them. Somehow they feel eas-
ier to fix. Leading does attract inherent problem solvers who tend to stick to 
the external factors like changing a policy or moving an office, things that are 
not necessarily related to people. Actually, the real blocks are inner blocks. It’s 
about the person or the people, the mindset, emotions and the limiting beliefs. 
Often there is less desire to go there because it feels like it might be a little bit 
messy and might result in people’s feelings being hurt.
“Sometimes you are in situations where somebody is completely stuck in 
a low Energy state. They are dragging a team down and despite lots of differ -
ent attempts, the person is just not shifting. Then you have to have one of the 
difficult conversations that Monica has talked about. Y ou can’t afford to put 
a plaster over the problem and see the Energy drain. Make sure you have that 
conversation today, because the team will be tired and looking to you to raise 
those Energy levels for everyone else. 
“ At other times, you will find that the problem is the combination of the 
people in a team, that they just do not really gel. There are conflicting personal -
ities, none of whom are wrong, but they struggle to work together. Y ou cannot 
duck this one either. Sometimes it’s as simple as just getting out of the office, 
especially if you see the impact of your work by getting out and reconnecting 
to the purpose.” 
236 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
“Sometimes it’s not systems, logistics, processes, people or teams, it’s you. 
There will always be people you struggle to work with. There will be times when 
you run yourself down and struggle to inspire yourself, never mind others. There 
will inevitably be triggers that go off in you, no doubt emerging unanticipated 
from your Essence. There will very rarely be moments when you get anything 
resembling a round of applause; mostly you will feel flattened by the regular 
insights into your failures that everyone around you provides.
“Y ou have to tune into how your Energy is transferring to others and 
also how theirs is transferring to you. There will be people who make you feel 
drained and tired and a bit overwhelmed, and there will be others who have the 
opposite effect on you. Pay attention to that Energy transfer and how you want 
to adjust it, then start experimenting in how to bring in your Energy in different 
situations when you pick up different vibes. When to stop and listen. 
“When you do, you may find that the Energy level is sliding downwards 
because people are feeling vulnerable or angry or afraid or all of these and more. 
And you are feeling these things too. Don’t just become some sort of cheer -
leader who brushes concerns aside. Or you may find that it’s sliding because 
people have lost sight of what it was all about. Then it’s not cheerleading they 
need from you, but rather a beautifully expressed reminder of what the purpose 
is, why it is important and how it will be achieved. Because you need to scoop 
people up, lift their sights, throw your own Energy in and ask them to rally.” 
(Podcast 59) 
This elegant judgement must be the magic Olivia spoke of when she de -
scribed leading done beautifully. It’s the invitation that Martyna made with an 
elegant hand gesture that had no need for words. It’s the ponytail flick that 
Kelly gave when she called for more from her star player.
Shedding
Melissa Kwee is adding to our list now. Just as Sarah has warned us about being 
hoarders of Energy, worried that there isn’t enough to go round, Melissa says 
you have to do the opposite and just give it away.
Energy | 237
“Energy is ultimately something to give away, responsibly, so that people 
feel trusted, responsible and empowered. Y ou share energy with care: the intent 
is that it moves in a direction that is broadly established and agreed upon, that 
it rests not on a single party but within and across a group of individuals who 
have chosen a common destiny. After all, it takes a network to fight a network.  
“So it’s not occasionally, but really as often as is appropriate, and I hope it 
is often and that there is a great joy in giving Energy away.” 
 Harriet Nayiga smiled when I met her soon after and I told her about 
Melissa’s words. She then brought a note of caution in: “Don’t forget that it is 
easier to give it away when you have masses of it. T ake care not to be too gen -
erous. If you strip yourself of power in order to create the Energy for change 
in a traditional space, it will not always work. Y ou may have to hold onto your 
Energy and use it yourself. Otherwise you get thrown to the back. Be careful 
about restricting yourself or showing that you are vulnerable, because they will 
use your vulnerability against you.” (Podcast 28)
Olivia came in rapidly behind Harriet and then went in a different direc-
tion. She sees change coming and predicts that it will be very different for her 
generation: “Before, I think we could find Energy and power was measured on 
how much information you had that other people did not have. Now, with my 
generation, it is more about how we can combine our knowledge and Energy 
together. So it is all about sharing, everything is about sharing: how can my idea 
be improved or implemented, how can my Energy be exponential if I do not 
share it with someone else?” (Podcast 42)
Positioning
Olivia then asked me about whether it was best to generate Energy for change 
from outside a system or from inside. I took this one to Lissa and Uma. Lissa 
chose the inside, Uma the outside. They both recognise the need for both to 
combine.
Lissa “It’s best to combine the internal and external energies. It takes both. 
Because once you get labelled a radical, you will struggle internally and you will 
no longer be heard. So as an insider seeking to produce the Energy for change, 
238 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
you carefully cultivate relationships with ‘radicals’ from the outside, to learn 
their perspective and translate it into one that can be heard internally.”
Lissa saw this happen in the US military “On the issue of allowing gays 
and lesbians to serve. Y ou had all of these perceived radicals on the outside de -
manding change, and it was very easy for the United States Congress and the 
US military to say, ‘we cannot hear you; you do not understand our world’ and 
‘the walls will crumble if we allow gay people in.’ But over time, gay people in 
the military became more visible, and because they were such a deep part of the 
culture, it was impossible for the military to not hear them. Particularly because 
so many gay people were great soldiers. It took a long time, but it was those gay 
soldiers who were carefully aligned and in relationship with the external ‘radi-
cals’ who pulled it off.
“It’s these coalitions across the institutional membrane that maintain the 
Energy to drive change because, from the outside, you risk being ignored and 
from the inside you risk being rejected. But even from the inside, sometimes, 
very rarely, you have to toss a hand grenade in the room and blow some things 
up to get the attention and to focus the Energy change. The hand grenade in the 
context of the US military was some of us coming out of the closet and saying, 
‘I’m gay.’ That just completely blew things up. All of a sudden, there was this 
cognitive dissonance. They had a respected and esteemed colleague in one part 
of their brain and in the other part they thought gay people were bad generally 
and really bad for the army. ‘Gay person, great soldier’ was confusing. That is 
what prompted real change from the inside. In the end, it was all about timing. 
“For sure there are some change agents who believe in just blowing stuff  
up so that it has to be recreated, but I love the military too much for that and I 
think I can create Energy to change it in easier ways.” (Podcast 5)
Uma opts for the outside. She has spent years creating Energy from there 
and recommends it because, for her, it ‘connects to my Essence and soul’ 
(Podcast 62) and for five other reasons:
 • Y ou get the benefit of more solitude, during which you can con -
nect better with your Essence.
Energy | 239
 • Y ou have more freedom to listen to the voice of intuition within 
yourself. Y ou can also sense more from the outside.
 • Being on the outside means that you know what it feels like to be 
excluded, which makes you much more inclusive in your leading.
 • Y ou can see the bigger picture and you don’t get lost in the details 
of the systems you are supposed to be maintaining. 
 • Y ou are unconstrained by rules, beliefs and loyalties that you 
are expected to accept inside. It gives you more room to grow in 
whichever way you like.
Then Uma reflected some more on the effect that being an outsider has on 
you: “Y ou are less easily frightened by the prospect of being on the outside. Y ou 
know what it feels like and have survived it, so it is no great terror. This gives you 
an edge because, for many, losing their power is the greatest of terrors.”
Of course, there are shadowy sides to being an outsider, as Uma says: “There 
is a real danger that you begin to believe that you will only ever belong when 
you are on the outside. Y ou get entrenched in the margins and can slip into de -
stroying and disrupting things around you without a purpose. Y ou start feeling 
like you are a stranger to yourself, someone who does not fit in anywhere, who 
is only ever an observer on the outside looking in. Sometimes you then start to 
read all the things that happen to you as people trying to keep you out. Y ou can 
become quite paranoid. Y ou believe that the world is unsafe, that nobody wants 
you and you cannot connect with anybody because they are all there to harm 
you or keep you out.” (Podcast 62)
With this daunting warning in mind, I reflect that as someone who invari-
ably chooses the outside (it’s in my Essence). I will at least always be with Uma. 
And that’s good.
I have a feeling we might find Ayesha there too, though she has a condition 
as she joins us: “Outside is good, but let’s not waste too much Energy creating 
new spaces for change. Let’s find the ones that are already there and use them” . 
So outside and inside will need to be added to our ever increasing list of 
Elements that we must combine as we lead. Creating Energy from the inside 
or the outside, both feel right at the right time, and for the right person. And 
240 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
this brings me back to something Alia said at the start of her advice on how to 
reverse a spiral. She said, “First I Check my own Energy” . 
It’s Y ou 
When you are leading, whether you choose to lead from the front, back, middle 
or sides, your own Energy level is key. As the person leading, the Energy level is 
your responsibility, and quite a personal one. There is no getting away from this.
Figure 11: Energy from you
Helena: “It’s your own personal enthusiasm that generates the Energy. People 
who seem to be flat in their engagement often have difficulty generating it. Y our 
enthusiasm, passion and persona often create – if not stimulate – the Energy. It 
is an Energy that people feel externally from you, but which is really a manifes-
tation of the Energy inside you.” (Podcast 29)
Helena is well known for her straight talking. And so is Uma; she says she calls 
for “women to claim their Energy and their resulting power in its purest sense.” 
Uma: “I don’t mean this in the usual way, in the context of position, struc-
tures, titles, budgets and institutions. There have been moments when I have 
experienced immense power and there are moments when I have felt extremely 
Energy | 241
powerless, and neither had anything to do with the positional power that I have 
enjoyed. 
“I see Energy rather as being in your own space, where your voice matters 
and your opinion is valued, and you are authentic and true, whether that is a 
playground or a parliament. It is a very calming space, and also extremely excit -
able because you are so full of Energy. Not an Energy that is driving you to do 
something, but an Energy of simply being.”
I asked Uma for an example of when she last felt so powerful, and the ex -
ample she gave me was drawn from motherness. As she spoke, her eyes shined. 
I am not sure whether it was with pride or with tears or a combination of both.
“The last time I felt very powerful was with my 17-year-old daughter. She 
was going through an internal critical crisis; she was very sad and very vulner -
able. She called me. I was about an hour away from her by car. I said, ‘let’s just 
talk.’ W e cried together, we laughed together, it was an extremely vulnerable 
and intimate time for both of us. She influenced me. I influenced her. It was an 
hour and fifteen minutes before I reached home.
“I call those seventy-five minutes powerful because for me they came from 
a deep space of self-efficacy and compassion. W e connected very deeply and 
intimately as two women sharing things about our lives.  
“When I reached home, we just hugged each other and then I went to do 
chores and she went to study. In those seventy-five minutes, I was connected 
with myself and the purpose of my life, the meaning of being born a woman, of 
having the privilege to mother a daughter.” 
Uma’s story is of her daughter. But it is not just about daughters. What 
Uma describes is certainly how I have occasionally felt with people I have led. 
When I get it right – which doesn’t always happen – it feels right. It’s why lead -
ing is wonderful. 
“It is when your spirit, your will and your intellect come together. It brings 
vitality and gives you an Energy. As women, we have been outsiders to power for 
such a long time. Maybe we need to recognise just how much that has framed 
what we think about power. There is a danger that we concentrate on the pow -
242 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
ers we do not have. Maybe we must take care not to dismiss all the infinite 
Energy that we possess.” (Podcast 62)
T emi, the young, passionate Nigerian environmental activist, feels it as 
she grasps the Energy her generation of women know they possess: “W e give 
ourselves permission to create Energy. The tides are changing. And it is really 
beautiful to see.” (Podcast 42)

Journal
Solo
Focus on Energy. T alk to people who create it. Ask if you can shadow them. W atch 
what they do and how people respond. 
Look at how they manage their own Energy, how they stimulate Energy in 
others and how they build a microclimate of Energy around them. 
Really quiz them on avoiding the dead ends, whether they have always man -
aged to or how they have learned the hard way.
Make sure that you are still talking to people from different cultures, gener-
ations, beliefs and geographies. People who do things in a very different way from 
you. How does someone half or double your age generate Energy? How do you 
avoid the Energy dead ends if you are in the global north or the global south? 
What causes Energy to spiral upwards when you are leading in one setting and yet 
has the opposite effect in another? 
Distil what you think will work for you. Some will, some won’t. T ake snippets 
from every conversation and build up how you will create Energy in the different 
settings you lead in.
In a group
Y ou will have got to know each other by now. Give each other feedback.
And invite me to come and join you on your Expedition for an hour or so. I 
would be honoured.
244 |Finale
So that’s it. W e are done. Over to you. Don’t ask me to summarise; that’s not 
how Expeditions work. In any case, it really is up to you now. Y our journal must 
now be very full. Y our map is no doubt creased and scribbled on (if not physi-
cally, at least metaphorically). Don’t stop now. Just take a breath, then keep on 
exploring.
My Expedition
As I draw breath myself, I think about how the First Expedition has caused my 
Essence to evolve. I have discovered pieces that I had not recognised before, like 
‘the body’ . I have put names to other pieces, like ‘motherness’ . It has prompted 
me to think again about pieces that I would once have considered small – ‘ances-
tors, ’ for example – and now recognise as much bigger. It has challenged me to 
rethink the relative sizes of the pieces: for me, ‘education’ is now bigger, relative 
to ‘trauma’ . It has uncovered pieces that are individual to me, such as ‘outsider’ .
I have jettisoned and reframed Elements and added a few of my own to 
these lists. I have tested my purpose in leading – but I am not sharing the out -
come of this one (it’s private). I have gloried in the newly discovered ‘combined’ 
concept. I just wish I had found it earlier. I have always described myself as a 
‘strategic opportunist, ’  and  have always  been told that it doesn’t make sense. 
Now I know that it does.
Finale | 245
I have gladly taken many new tips from every single woman I have met over 
the last year. And I intend to continue my hunt (or rather my podcast hunt) for 
Expressing my leading.
Finally, I have realised that leading  really  is a verb.  And I now know its 
secret ingredient: Energy.
How do I know all this? Because my Essence has breathed the fresh air of 
the First Expedition. I have been put to the test, leading such a glorious group 
of determined women: Alia, Ana Luz, Andini, Anna, Aparna, Ayesha, Camila, 
Erica, Fatima, Folawe, Hinemoa, Isata, Katrina, Katya, Laura, Liz, Melissa, 
Mona, Rouba, Sarah, Selvie, Uma, Vidya, Yvette, Lissa, Stephanie and Maria. It 
feels like my infinity symbol has been set to fast forward over the last year, flow -
ing in both directions. I lead differently today because of it.
Y our Expedition
So now it’s your turn. And all I can say is: go. Go and lead, because we all have 
to. There is so much that needs leading – and so much that needs a fresh eye. W e 
cannot let leadership get stuck in titles and definitions. W e have to bring our 
Energy to leading – starting now.
And keep exploring as you go. Don’t stop your Expedition now – it has 
only just begun.
There are only 101 women’s voices in this book. There are more things 
to read, people to talk to, podcast episodes to listen to, questions to ask, an -
swers to be dug out. There are more pieces to uncover in your Essence and more 
Elements to draw from them. And there are so many different ways to express 
them. Learn all the time, and let the infinity symbol flow.
Build your Energy, because it’s a force that spirals upwards when you get 
your leading right. There are so many ways to make sure that the Energy you 
generate is effective, inspires people and has purpose. T ry them all.
There is a golden moment when Essence becomes clear: the three circles 
align; the Elements get jettisoned, reframed, found and combined; the infinity 
symbol flows gently across the three circles, connecting them as the inside ques-
tions the outside (and vice versa). It is a sweet and dynamic spot, and from it the 
246 | If That’s Leading, I’m In
infinity symbol takes off and spirals dynamically upwards, generating Energy as 
it goes.
So keep exploring. Find your own approach to leading that works for you. 
There is no single universal way: because that central circle – our Essence – is so 
very different and personal to each of us.
And yet, is it entirely different? As women, we share so much. For all our 
individual differences, there are many common pieces – and that is what makes 
us full of Energy when we are together.
Beyond the goal of all of us finding our own individual way to lead, just 
think, for a moment, of the bigger prizes to be won. 
When enough women choose to lead in a way that works for them, we 
might just begin to redefine leadership so that even more people choose to do it. 
W omen will no longer feel that they have to be something that they are 
not, and our sons will discover that this approach to leading resonates with 
them too.
And finally, women will take their rightful central role in leading a world 
that is facing huge challenges.
More than ever, it needs us leading the way.
Go go go
As you set off, I shall delight in watching your triumphs, quietly hoping that 
your Expedition played a small role in them.
I have two more hopes: that my map – and what is now your map – serves 
you well, and that, as you explore, you will tell me what you discover along the way.
I will be there for as long as I can – with luck, every week with another 
podcast episode, and every three weeks for a live session. I’ll be doing my best 
to address your questions, learn from your answers and add them to my journal, 
which is already bursting with ideas and images from the explorations that led 
to this book.
‘”Popping colours.” “The body is a barometer.” “The infinite game.” “10,000 
hours.” “Strawberries with chocolate and chocolate with tea.” “Let’s try it.” “The 
three seeds.” “Justajoo.” “The Vā.” “The silence between the notes.”  These are 
Finale | 247
just some of the words that are now etched into me, along with these images: a 
Polish conductor’s inviting hands, a rugby player rucking or flicking a ponytail, 
a frog boiling, a W onder W oman suit, a tiny theatre director with a tiny voice 
in Argentina, a ‘nosey’ supply chain director in the US, and the smiles of both a 
survivor of war in Uganda and a nun in Nepal. Leading, every single one of them.
Now it’s your turn. Go, go, go. This is leading – and you’re in. 
Love Julia
248 |Last Word
It was helping Julia to curate the Expedition, waking up at the crack of dawn to 
strategise with her and Vidya, and then becoming a member of the First Expe -
dition, that led me back to leading. For a few years, I had refused all offers, pre -
ferring my portfolio life. But discussions around leading made me think about 
myself and realise that, as someone with influence, how could I encourage other 
women to be authentic leaders if I did not show up myself ?
My journey of leading has followed a circular path, often tumultuous and 
non-traditional.
I started as an investment banker: a very male dominated world. It rewarded 
leading that was aggressive and intent on power-grabbing. Our compensation, 
rather than being judged on performance, was judged on who stood up for you 
in the room when evaluations were discussed. 
Now I am Global Executive Director of Equality Now, an organization 
that promises to shake up a system that was not created by or for women.  
In this new role, I have used many of the lessons highlighted in this book: 
understanding my Essence (deep commitment to gender equality), leaning into 
Elements (intuition, listening, purpose) and then being bold in Expression (an 
inclusive and abundant mindset, working hard but smart) so that I generate 
Energy.
I feel like I am in the sweet spot of my life, and being in the company of 
the most soul nourishing women during the First Expedition gave me the fuel I 
never knew I needed. W e talk often, but most of all know we have each other’s 
Last Word | 249
backs, not just in leading change but in our lives as well. I am available at any 
time of night or day to every member of the group and feel a deeply affirming 
sense of solidarity.  
After all, together we unlocked a way of leading that is true, fundamental and 
life-affirming. And the most beautiful part was realising that leading is individual and 
unique. This book will have helped you to find your way and, after all, for it to stick, it 
must surely be self-defined. 
Only then will we become streams of light, feeding into this beautiful prism of lead -
ing change.
I hope that you are enjoying your Expedition. It is a journey worth step -
ping into.
